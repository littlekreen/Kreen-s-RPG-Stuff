# Tavern Patrons
# This table is a composed from many sources of the web.
# These are not my descriptions, Just my format to Table Smith.
# If you make any changes or add new descriptions please send me a
# copy of the changes: odell_williams@hotmail.com
#
# Rolls random patrons for an inn or tavern
# Uses the Following Tables:
#	Miscellaneous 	By: Bruce A. Gulke
# This table when combined with Inn table (by me), Inn Events Table and
# Inn Menu Table (By: Bruce A. Gulke) makes a good complete Inn or Tavern.
#
# There are several var. that need to be set up.
#
#
#
# Modified by Valminder, May 2002 / July 2003.
#    I corrected some errors, added some {Plural~[]} functions and some 
#       {AorAn} OR {Cap} where applicable.
#    I changed the START line to put a {Loop~...} function instead.
#    I added a new line (25) to the table ":Tables" linking it to the
#       Rumors table.
#    I also linked this table with a few others:
#       Countries.Land
#       Creatures.Humanoid2 (for common races)
#       Creatures.Familiar
#       Miscellaneous.Color
#       Miscellaneous.Language
#       Miscellaneous.Metal
#       Miscellaneous.Precious Metal
#       Miscellaneous.Other Material
#       Religion.Deities
#       Rumors.Generate
#       Rune Generator.GenRune (from Monte Cook, to generate tatoos or signs)
#
#       :Race ==> [Creatures.Humanoid2]  (for more humanoids) 
#       :Elves Race ==> [Creatures.Elf]
#       All [weapons] subtable ==> [Equipment.Weapons] (to add wpns as we want)
#
#       NOTE: I put this table in the "~Reference" folder because I'll only
#             use it with the "Inn Generator" table.
#
# Modified by Valminder, August 2006.
#    I added Encounters and stuff from "InnEvents1.tab" by odell_williams@hotmail.com.
#    Added more chances for bards to appear in an Inn.
#    Changed "Inn Generator.tab" to call the "Inn Generator" subtable because Lockout~
#       does not work when the table is called from the outside.
#    Added some other kinds of bards, not only musicians, but dancers, buffoouns, etc.

1,her hands are folded presentably before herself but her expression is worried as she casts her eyes about the place as though unsure of what she is looking for
2,she scowls at a bevy of small even more austerely dressed girls. Whenever they fidget, smile or laugh, she scolds them very thoroughly
3,she seems to be practicing the flute, but so softly that you can only hear the occasional soft note. Her eyes are very pale blue and her face is sharp and freckled.
4,she is paying for 3 bottles of liquor. A young man approaches her and whispers something to her. She turns and slaps him, to which his friends in the corner laugh loudly, one falling out of his chair. The girl quickly takes the bottles and leaves
5,she is trying to talk her boyfriend into going home. He's had far too much to drink, and has convinced himself he's fallen in love with the waitress. There is a small bundle of new clothes sitting on the table
6,she affectionately pats an old dwarf on his bald head, and is calling him 'papa'
7,she dances on the long center table. Her hips move back and forth in time to the rhythm of a lively tune carried by the men sitting at the table. When the song ends, she bows, displaying her large, pale bosoms. The men bang their mugs and call for more, excitement and laughter in their voices
8,she looks as if she has never been in an inn before
9,she is sitting next to a middle-aged man in coveralls.  She has a firm grip on his arm as she looks around the room in a mixture of terror and excitement. He is smiling slightly and patting her hand. A bow leans against the wall behind him and a full quiver hangs at his belt
10,the combination of her dress and her posture leave little or nothing to the imagination. She is surely wanting to attract male attention, but is too well-dressed to be a whore, and doesn't look as if finding a bed partner is her goal
11,she sits expectantly, apparently waiting to be hired by someone
12,she glances almost casually at the men crowding around her, and heaves a big sigh. She sits down and looks towards the door hopefully, but looks crest fallen when no-one enters
13,one young man walks up to her, and gets a slap in the face for his effort much to the amusement of his companions
14,a man walks over to her, and she begins some kind of trance, like a psychic
15,she is singing in a language you don't quite understand, but you can tell the song is sad.  A long haired man next to her is weeping in his drink
16,the woman is offered a drink by the serving wench, but she shakes her head briskly and ignores the serving wench
17,she is spoon-feeding a stately elf, clad in a fine grey gown. He is clearly blind, and as you look across, she looks at you and gives you a brave but hopeful smile. Her food stands uneaten
18,four young men come over and entice her to follow them into their room

1,the smallest of them is very young indeed and also the most pretty. Her eyes shine very brightly when she speaks, and her hands move excitedly in accompaniment to her words
2,they whisper and giggle at this table. One fiddles constantly with a ribbon. The bright blue band seems to have several oddly shaped beads strung upon it, and she pulls them to and from with a curiously mesmerizing motion
3,they talk and giggle, as one of them promises to show the other some 'new dance moves'
4,they are leaning against the wall near one of the tables. If anybody takes a place there, the girls will begin to engage them in intense flirtation
5,they are telling each other about their husbands in loud, shrill voices.  As you look at them, one of them  a seems to look past you and smile at someone behind you
6,they have purple splotches on their clothes and ingrained into their skin. As they eat their pottage and drink cheap ale you hear them talking. It ain't right, I've seen how much he gets for the purple cloth, five times what he pays for it! We does all the work & he pays us almost nothing'. It ain't right
7,they have taken a seat by the fire. Partially finished meals sit before them, forgotten, as they cast furtive glances at the barkeep whom you sees to be a very handsome man, in his way. The girls are giggling amongst themselves about his charms in a feeble attempt not to be overheard
8,they are gossipy shrewdly about someone called [Fantasy Names.Start]. Three of them say nothing but horrid, cold things about her, while the fourth seems rather more compassionate, often biting her tongue and looking shocked by things the others say
9,all appear to be quite young and beautiful, but you can not be sure because of the dim lighting
10,they are counting the days takings. They are dressed shabbily and look weary
11,they are holding hands with each other. They are ignoring the food in front of them, choosing to look lovingly at each other, and occasionally stopping their conversation to kiss each other sensually with open mouths. No one around seems to mind
12,they are experimenting with cosmetics
13,they are looking around the room pointing at the men and laughing and smiling

1,They look tired, and the dust on their shoes and clothing suggests that they have been travelling some distance on foot. The children have lifeless weary eyes, and they sit quietly with their parent as if noisy play was the last thing on their minds
2,The smallest child is playing contentedly with a miniature hedgehog that he had secreted away in his pouch. When he giggles, the mother looks over and says, <i>Junior, put that hedgehog down! You don't know where it's been.</i>
3,They are dressed poorly and look as if they don't have two pennies to rub together. The young children are thin but are happily playing as their dad  reassures their ma : <i>Don't worry, there will be work in the city. You can stay at your brothers farm `till we get set</i>
4,The father is enjoying an after dinner ale, while the mother suckles the youngest. The young boys, are playing bonkers. Each has a fire hardened horse chestnut threaded on to the end of a string. They take turns letting their nut hang down while the other swings his into it, hoping to shatter the hanging nut
5,One of the children asks a question, and the parents laugh, though it looks strained
6,The man is wearing a well worn [Armor] armor and has dual {Plural~[Swords]} strapped on his back, whereas the woman and children seem normal peasants. The man is leaning over the table towards the woman and speaks to her in a hushed voice. The children seem disinterested & bored
7,One of the boys removes a live frog from a crock at his feet to tease his sister with. <i>Put him back now!</i> the mother threatens, <i>or your father will be very angry with you when we find a Wizard to change him back</i>
8,They talk of crops and taxes, and plan what they will do with the much anticipated surplus Their clothes and their mannerisms are rough, but you get the impression that they are happy
9,They are playing some sort of game involving tiles which are placed on top of each other. The boy is happy and the others are laughing. The young woman appears to have a [Miscellaneous.Metal]-handled [Knifes] and a purse
10,They seem disinterested about other people in the tavern, except for the boy who looks around now and then and stares at the other patrons
11,They wear patched, dirty clothes and broken shoes. The man tries to calm the boy who looks like he's going to burst into tears. He says: <i>Don't worry, son. We'll find her yet. I'm sure of it</i>
12,They eat the cheapest dishes and look nervously around for someone to say they do not belong here
13,Their faces are carved with the lines of a hard life, their noses red from the merciless sun
14,The son is telling of how he wishes to travel
15,They are trying to explain craftsmanship to %B% son. <i>A Dwarven music box will be plain but will withstand anything. Humans build functionally.

2,all of a sudden one jumps up and screams <i>I saw it!. It was the biggest whale I have ever seen!</i> The other sailors laugh loudly
3,they clank tankards together and begin a rousing chorus of Yo ho ho ho!. A salty sea dogs sit across from one another, staring at the cards in their hands. They slowly lower them, then one of them throws them down in disgust as the other gathers a pile of copper coins with a greedy smile
4,one of them is slapped by the <b>[Creatures.Humanoid2]</b> serving girl after whispering something in her ear. His companion laughs at him and then continues with his drinks
5,they are hunched over a cross shaped game board playing pirates and keep. Several Ales have slowed their play. There are 24 pirate ships and only 2 defenders.

When one of the Sailors starts dancing a jig both of the halflings drunkenly try to match his motions, much to the amusement of the other Sailors
9,they are raising their mugs while they harmonize a sea chantey. While the volume is quite loud and the subject matter lurid and violent, the tune is catchy and their voices beautiful. A gaggle of peasant children gathers around them, their worshipful stares ignored by the happy seamen

13,one of them decides to brush the barmaid's breast as she serves drinks. She smiles, which he takes as encouragement. When she turns around, he stands and presses his body against her. She spins and knees him in the groin, sending him to the floor among the laughter of his friends
14,one of them approaches the <b>[Creatures.Humanoid2]</b> girl at the bar. He says something to her, which you can't hear, but you guess at its meaning when she splashes her drink in his face
15,they're-discussing mending their nets in the morning
16,you can hear rumors of an undiscovered continent emanating from group
17,one of them is sketching something on a piece of parchment. When you look over, you see that it's the front of a ship. He is drawing in the sculpture for the front
18,<i>yer cap'n sucks chum! 'e couldn't navigate himself into woman, much less the seas!</i> you hear one shout. A rival crew is standing around a table in the back, hands at their weapons. <i>Yer cap'n is a yellow-livered scurvy frail!</i> It looks like a fight is very near breaking out

20,the remains of a substantial meal and a flock of empty tankards clutter the table before them. One of them is humming to himself as he patiently carves a scrimshaw picture into an [~Miscellaneous.Other Material] handled [Knifes]
21,they are mocking their sea mate who is rapidly tying a series of intricate knots into fine cords of silk. <i>You can make fun all you want</i> the <b>[Creatures.Humanoid2]</b> counters <i>but I've sold every blessed bracelet I wove the entire voyage.
