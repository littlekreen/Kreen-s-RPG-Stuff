#Named Items
;Start
1,<b>Garamos' Skin of Evil</b>: This is a suit of armor that when worn by any evil creature, gives it the access to a single "wish" spell, but when worn by good, it does 1d4 damage each round worn. 
1,<b>Garamos' Helm of Summoning</b>: This was worn in many of Garamos's battles, and is probably the most well known of his items. It summons the spirits and ghosts of any creatures who died in that area and takes control of them. 
1,<b>Skull of Garamos</b>: This is just as it sounds. Garamos's skull. Although many think it is merely more than a skull, a magic-user can clearly see that it radiates negative energy and can be used to call upon Garamos himself's spirit if a command word is spoken. 
1,<b>Grishnak's Thousand Keys</b>: Grishnak, being a borderline OCD (obsessive-compulsive disorder) orc, loved to collect keys. The walls of his cave are covered in dozens of key rings, all full of keys of all sorts and sizes. Have a good laugh at your player's expression as you describe the orc's strange treasure trove. So many keys, so little time. 
1,<b>Kepenepta's Log</b>: On the outside an unassuming, usually unadorned book, one would never guess the treasure hidden inside. The book always opens in the center, it is completely and utterly impossible to open closer to the front or back. You could turn the pages forever and never reach the end of the book. And if you seek something you know to be written in the book, you can simply turn the page and it will be there. If you have never seen this particular book before, you always start on the first written page and turn pages in the order they were written. Magical spells scribed into this book lose their potency, so it is useless as a spell book. 
1,<b>Brodrick's Armor</b>: After Lord Brodrick slew the dragon he was wise enough to try to save everything that might be of value. This was a bit of a nuisance for the servants brought along to pack the goods out, but such is a servants life. Amongst the items brought out was a large jar filled with the dragons blood. Brodrick gave this blood and a very fine suit of armor to an artist of some renown. Using the extremely acidic blood like paint, the artist painted a beautiful scene depicting the slaying of the dragon on the breast plate of the armor. The greaves were decorated with pictures of the gods, and the helm with the Heraldic Shield of the city. The acid of the blood destroyed a prodigious amount of paintbrushes, but by the time he was done the armor was some of the most beautiful in the lands. In time, the blood began to fade and come off. This, however, was not a problem, as the acid had etched the scene into the armor. Now, hundreds of years later, none of the blood remains visible, but the scene looks as newly etched as though done yesterday by a master. One minor side effect of wearing the armor... the wearer of the armor wields a scaled down version of the Dragon Panic. Brodrick's Armor disappeared 100 years after it's creation, when his weak grandson's keep was sacked in the succession wars. It's location remains unknown. 
1,<b>Luth-Ax</b> Passed down the Luth family line, this masterwork great-ax was used by fighters and paladins to fend off the hordes and demons. It is of ancient design, combining a nearly 3-foot curved blade offset by a spike. The bottom of the shaft includes a wedge of metal designed as a weapon breaker. The ash handle is wrapped with criss-crossing wire allowing for a light, strong weapon. 
1,<b>Mirander Mocha Koffee deBaen's Coffee Book</b>: The eccentric wildmage Mirander 'the Mochamaker' deBaen penned this book while trying to stop Judas deKaf from percolating Jesus (hey Zeus!). It contains all of his precious coffee recipes. 
1,<b>The masks of Uru</b>: A set of different-colored masks that grant the bearer different kinds of sight such as darkvision/infravision/detect invisibility and such. Collect them all to construct a mask that gives you eternal True sight! 
1,<b>Corison's Map </b>- This item is actually 5 different leather items - belt, boots, gloves, great sword scabbard, and backpack - which should be found separately. Each is formed of tanned demon hide, beautifully worked, and covered in engraved symbols. There is an obvious thematic connection between the items, as the leather, the craftsmanship, and the symbology is all consistent. The script on the separate items cannot be deciphered, but if the items' symbols are somehow joined (such as by taking rubbings of each item and working the "puzzle" thus created), they can be deciphered (Decipher Script (DC 25)) as a textual map to a treasure hoard. (Of course, the hoard is guarded by an imprisoned demon.) Each separate item is worth between 15-20 gp - as a set they'll fetch 200 gp, if the PCs can find a buyer who clues in on the map. Corison, by the way, was a famous demon-hunting ranger from the previous century. 
1,<b>Bugbear morning star</b>. The morning star of a bugbear tribe leader has the history of the clan and its relative power etched on it in their bloodthirsty tongue. Possession of this item can lead to prestige in the community, and also to being the object of a vengeful attack by the clan remnants... 
1,<b>Tapestry of Mergoathia</b>: Large (4m across, 8m down) non magic tapestries hand stitched by 6 elven maidens using only the finest threads to depict a massive battle between two human kingdoms. The weave so fine that almost every drop of blood spilt on the battlefield is depicted. The tapestries are woven with a story, each tapestry containing a scene of the battle at the beginning (2), middle (2) and end (2). There is a total of 6 tapestries and all are enigmatic as to who won until the final tapestry. Hung in order they would make a most impressive set. 
1,<b>Baltheza's Befuddled Rug of Ensnaring</b>: Created by the would be Mage Baltheza, this rug is his first attempt to create a magic item. Procuring a large (2m x 4m) rug, with rich red, gold and silver weaving for his spell, he attempted to ensorcell this rug to catch intruders. However during the process of creation he spilt a drop of water from the river Styx on the rug which he then attempted to clean off with a potion of healing that he had confused with a vial of holy water. He enspelled the rug thinking his mistake had been repaired and had his apprentice Iyrons test it. The rug did nothing. Enraged by his failure to create a useful rug he had his apprentice throw the rug out. Little did he know that the rug was sold by Iyrons to a wealthy adventurer who thought the rug looked good. <BR><BR>The warrior and his adventuring party used the rug as a totem until, during a fight with a chaos beast, the standard was dropped by the party bard as he fell in combat and was accidentally drooled on by the chaos beast. The magical spittle combined with the water of the Styx and the potion of healing, and the unactivated magic triggered the rug to awareness. The semi-sentient rug proceeded to engulf the chaos beast and crush it to death with a malevolent fury but instead healed the beast before accidentally letting it go. <BR><BR>The adventuring party finally slew the chaos beast and dragged the now slumbering rug back to town where they sold it to an eccentric man. The rug was then lost but has periodically turned up in pub tales about insane rugs who erratically chomped on people, healing them in the process. The owners of the rug always sell it because of how sporadically the rug would terrorize guests by chomping on them. Such a rug would make for an interesting conversation piece for not many people have insane malevolent rugs who heal people through attempts to kill them. 
1,<b>Blademaster's Ben-Wa Balls of Concentration</b>: For that casual, oh-so-professional look desired by aspiring sword- swingers and would-be masters of the blade. These are two small round silver and steel composite balls that make a pleasant vibration and a soft sound when held and massaged in one hand. They can be taken out and held/ rolled just about anywhere. Eliminates tense arm muscles that can ruin reflexes (but a REAL blademaster should NEVER be tense, right?). This translates into: maybe a small reaction check bonus, or a bonus to surprise checks (an appropriate situation would be in a tavern, not walking through a cave littered with monsters), and a lessening of penalties to attack for fatigue. 
1,<b>Jhonen's Meadow</b>: The deed to four acres of rolling, grassy meadow surrounded by a forest of birch, printed carefully on a yellowed one-foot square card with a shiny royal seal. It smells faintly of orange tea and has obviously been folded and re-folded a number of times. The reverse side is decorated with a complex geometrical design in faded blue ink. 
1,<b>Moireach Ni'Angualha's Harp</b>: A very beautiful harp made out of dark wood, with inlays of gold. The strings itself are made out of silver. The harp belonged to a beautiful elven bard(ess). The only magical quality it has is that it is always perfectly tuned. 
1,<b>Thunder Child</b>: A mithril plated warhammer that once belonged to a long forgotten dwarven lord. Three times a day the wielder may call out the weapons name "Thunder Child!" and thunder (sonic blast) booms out in a cone of sound causing all in its range to take damage. 
1,<b>Sari's Fire Glass</b>: A chalice carved out from a single large ruby, making it translucent red in color. Made by an artisan generations ago as a wedding present to a foreign princess coming to marry the local prince of the age, this treasure was stolen by looters when the palace burned down, and then subsequently stolen by a red dragon for his hoard. 
1,<b>Korva's Sphere</b>: It's original purpose unclear, this is a rather damaged glass sphere with a powerful curse on it. Discovered by the wizard Korva, anything except ice that touches it will fall into profoundly disastrous circumstances (actual game effect: DM will be mercilessly cruel to target. For example, you could cause the ocean to flood the city the characters are in, and have a fire break out so that the escape route is blocked. If it helps, imagine that the target has just broken up with your sister). 
1,<b>Korva's Curse</b>: This spell was devised by Korva soon after discovering the Sphere (see above). With it, he was able to have the effects of the Sphere be applied to a target of his choosing, merely by placing the ball between himself and the target, gesturing and chanting the appropriate words. This spell was recorded on a single scroll, made from the skin of a badger (fur still intact). Of course, placing the ball so that its effects don't touch the caster may be difficult. 
1,<b>Elemental daggers</b>: A set of four daggers with an elemental theme. Windcutter, Seatamer, Flamequencher and Stonebreaker. Each one does triple damage against one element. The trick is to only give your players one or two, but in a case or display built for four. You bet they'll always be searching for the others (and the people who have the others will be searching for the ones the PC's have). 
1,<b>Epaphos's Tubes</b>: Hollowed tubes made out of a dark purple wood, varying is size from toe length to finger length. Most contain corked tops, unless the tops were lost to time. Made by anonymous wizard Epaphos, who carried precious powders and spices inside the tubes for spells and cooking. Perhaps some mysterious powder is even remaining in some of the tubes? 
1,<b>Dust of Terreus</b>: Oilskin pouch, with tightly sewn seams, contains dust from the plateaus of Terreus. Dust is comprised of soft pale blue granules and prickly black specks. If wetted, a swarm of gnats, which were hibernating in the dust, emerge to the irritation of the dust's carrier. 
1,<b>Gift of Krudge</b>: This a 3" gold and jewel encrusted disk with evil orc images will normally be found in a tomb in the dead hand of an Orc leader. 
1,<b>The Three Hornets</b>: A curious collection of 3 light throwing knives with an unusual power that isn't obvious. When one of these knives is thrown it inflicts damage as per a standard throwing knife, but as soon as it hits a solid object the remaining two knives attempt to follow and strike the same target. A skilled user, who knows the secret of the Three Hornets, will toss the first two into the air (no roll necessary under normal circumstances) before throwing the 3rd knife (make standard ranged weapon roll). The remaining knives strike the same object as the first one, whether it hit it's intended target or not. If one knife is thrown while the other two are held, or stored somewhere the thrower may get a nasty surprise. If held in the thrower's hand, it will feel as though something has pulled the knives from the hand (make dexterity roll not to drop them) and they may be wounded. If in a belt or backpack, for example, the knives may cut their way through, although they will then simply fall to the ground having already encountered a solid object. 
1,<b>Grays Song</b>: A song in the PC's honor composed by the most famous bard in the land. 
1,<b>Walking stick carved out of the thigh bone of a giant</b>. (carvings match the type of giant: fire giant = flames, cloud giant = clouds & wind, etc.) 
1,<b>Acorn of the Great Oak</b>: This is an acorn from the Great Oak, jealously guarded by the Druidic orders of the West. This particular acorn must have been captured from them by evil forces. If it still has potency, it can be used in the New Planting Ceremony to lessen the chances of the protected forests seeing disasters such as fire or clearing by humans. 
1,<b>"The Value of Amaranth" Oil Painting</b>: A tremendously large oil painting of mostly 1:2 scale winged men and women, with both bird wings and bat wings, in pitched battle amongst the clouds, with an earthly city depicted below, with everyday people going about their lives. The canvas is roughly 46'x16' (yes, more than four stories along one side), with a gilded wooden frame. This frame is also exquisitely carved with depictions of angels and demons, in addition to animals such as goats, eagles, lions, and scorpions, and the occasional mortal man, all interacting with each other. The centerpeice of the frame is at the bottom, and appears as a beautiful flower, opening to the sun. For its sheer immensity and detail over such a large area, it is sought after by kings who wish to make a statement of their own power. 
1,<b>"Ascension of the High Paladin"</b>: This painting is 3 by 4 yards. It depicts the ascension ceremony of High Paladin Lord Adragan Zaldrun II, and shows in minute detail the faces of all senior paladins and priests who attended the ceremony. It is said to contain the answer to where Lord Zaldrun hid the Holy Breastplate before the Coming of the Second Darkness. The painting was made by the famed half-elf painter Kerrigar Feltenspar. 
1,<b>Erasmus's Bolts of Force</b>: The magelord Erasmus the Learned often overcame his lack of metamagic feats by crafting new versions of older spells. Erasmus's Bolts of Force is a Wiz 3/Sor 3 version of Magic Missile that can be cast with no components, effectively as if the Silent Spell and Still Spell feats had been applied to it. In all other ways, it functions identically to Magic Missile. 
1,<b>Ethran Blades</b>: Ethran Blades appear as masterwork weapons that were made many centuries ago. They hold a dim magical aura which can be awakened by meditation in a Place of Power (holy site for a particular religion, crossing point of ley lines, whatever the DM imagines). <BR><BR>To activate a new power from an Ethran Blade, the owner must spend a dayin meditation and a 1000gp in rare incenses for every 1000gp of market value that is the difference between its previous magical quality rating and its new magical quality rating. (i.e. To first activate an Ethran Blade to a +1 enchantment, the market value for a magical weapon increases 2000 gp. So the owner must spend 2 days and 2000gp in incense, while meditating in a Place of Power, to make the item a +1 weapon.) <BR><BR>The enchanted blade only functions for the current owner. In the hands of others, the Ethran Blade only functions as a masterwork weapon. A Place of Power can only be used once to open a new ability for an owner of a particular Ethran Blade. A new ability of each blade can only be opened once per experience level gained by the owner, and the order of powers is usually determined by the DM. <BR><BR>For example: The Axe of Moritus is an Ethran Blade created for a vile and evil blackguard centuries ago. The progression of abilities for the Axe of Moritus is: (+1) +1 enhancement bonus; (+2) +2 enhancement bonus; (+3) keen magical ability; (+4 and +5, big jump to activate the next power here) unholy magical ability; (+6) frost magical ability; (+7) +3 enhancement bonus; (+8) +1 icy burst magical ability; (+9) +4 enhancement bonus; (+10) +5 enhancement bonus. For color, the DM may require the character to meditate in places of war, bloodshed, and sacrifice in order to grant these abilities to the weapon. (Inspired by the Samurai ancestral daisho ability, but given to the weapon instead of a class.) 
1,<b>"This note</b> entitles the bearer to one wish (signed) Boddle": This note, which appeared valuable or just a scribble on a piece of paper, sent the characters halfway across the country side, finding out who Boddle was and where he could be found. Fortunately, he was a powerful wizard and did grant the wish that was promised on the paper. 
1,<b>Sulamein's Boots of Travel</b>: These boots appear simple and well made. When worn they protect the wearer's feet from the elements keeping them warm (or cool) and dry regardless of the environment that the wearer is walking through. They automatically adjust to fit perfectly and will clean themselves overnight. 
1,<b>Isengeld</b>, The Shining Spear, Giantsbane. This is a magically enchanted spear. It glows a light blue in the dark and is cold to touch. It is enchanted with cold and has been specifically designed to slay all kinds of Giant. 
1,<b>Kendor's Pipe</b>: The pipe is made of dark wood and doesn't look special in any way. It was made for Kendor, a priest who liked smoking while reading. When used, a continual light appears about 1 foot over the head of the pipe. 
1,<b>Kendor's Helm</b>: A massive helm, made of black metal in the form of a bear head, the opening for the face is through the wide-open mouth of the bear. The eyes of the bear are closed but the delicate lids can be opened. When opened in darkness the eyes (two beautiful yellow gems) begin to glow and create enough light to see 20'. 
1,<b>Kendor's Cloak</b>: A dwarven-sized cloak made from the pelt of a winter-wolf. It protects the wearer not only from 'normal' cold but from cold-based attacks as well and makes him more difficult to spot in snowy terrain. 
1,<b>Sledge of the Mountain</b>: This heavy mace of orcish crafting is one of its kind. It's one of the magical weapons the orcs and the dark elves (the drow) created. With metals from the inner core of Mount Orc (occupied by, yes, orcs) and enchanted with magics long forgotten by the higher dark elven wizards, the mace truly is a destructive weapon. <BR><BR>The mace itself is quite unpleasant and heavy to hold, since the orcs really doesn't care about things like comfort (they care only for the power of their items), and it isn't very pretty either. But its wearer wouldn't care about such things. When worn, the mace gives its wearer the strength of thousand orcs and after some time, a frightful appearance. It's said that one of the dark elven wizards failed so that the weapon became lethal to its wearer. It actually starts the rot process that normally starts when someone dies. After a year or two, the wearer will look like a zombie or a rotten corpse, and a terrible smell will emanate from him. But some don't care for these things and use the mace until their death. <BR><BR>One of its wearers is said to have been the greatest orc king that has ever lived, Orgnark. He found its former holder in the depths of Underdark. After a long battle, his soldiers defeated the undead (or so they believed it was) who they thought was a demigod of some kind. But when Orgnak understood that he had found the legendary Sledge of the mountain, he slew all the soldiers who was with him. Once back on his throne, he started the most offensive and expansive campaign ever done. He conquered half of the known world before he was assassinated by his own sons. They all wanted the power of the mace, and in the battle that followed, it was once again lost. No one knows now where it is, but it is certain that when it's found, the great armies of the orcs will do anything to get it back. 
1,<b>Octavious (wooden bat, magical)</b>. Octavious, was a weapon carried by the legendary Dellaron the Wise, a monk of great power. Dellaron was forbidden from carrying edged weapons by his sovereign and so set about gathering the spells, woods, gems, and experience he needed to fabricate and enchant a powerful weapon he could wield in combat. Octavious is crafted from wood that is deep yellow (unknown species), with a smooth iron band around the bludgeoning end. The handle is inset with 14 various gems that carry the permanent enchantments, but are unseen under a wrap of hide- like leather that always remains tactile and soft. <BR><i>Octavious' powers are:</i> <UL><LI>*Indestructible (the very physical substance of the bat resists fire, cutting, splintering, and shattering. Whether that is a natural attribute of the wood or is an enchantment is unknown). <LI>* Thunderbolt. Any creature struck by the weapon must roll vs. electrical damage from the discharge made by the bat. (No set damage level, you decide based on your campaign. Even a low damage would still make this weapon very valuable if it could happen every time it was used.) <LI>Line Drive. Any small (baseball size to marble size) projectile tossed up and struck by the bat has 90% chance of striking the intended target. The projectile travels at twice the speed of a slingshot and does twice the normal damage for the projectile-type. Maximum distance is the wielders Strength times 100 feet (STR: 12 X 100 = 1200 feet or 3 football fields). Anything larger than a softball will most likely trip the Thunderbolt and destroy the object entirely. <LI>Considered a +3 weapon. <LI>Does double damage against lawful evil and undead of any type.</UL>
