#Art and Furniture
;Start
1,<b>Fine Art</b> : Rare and beautiful pieces, fished out of the dankest dungeons of the world. The awe of these rare or well painted works can be quite miraculous. The owner of the paintings can be considered to have one or two points higher charisma than they really have (while being near them). This can be interesting with the players inviting those they wish favour from to their abode so they are wonder struck by the art and are easier to persuade. The higher the character's charisma the more paintings he'll need to have an affect. 
1,<b>Old Vases</b> : Beautiful and useful for holding flowers. In fact perhaps because of their age or method of manufacture, these vases will keep flowers alive and well for far longer than should be possible, perhaps for years!! This is helpful for adventures who can't be bothered with replacing flowers and other little things all the time. In fact after dungeoneering for weeks, they may come back to find the flowers still fresh. BTW, flowers help keep a house smelling nice...important considering where adventurers and their gear tend to go. 
1,<b>Ornamental suits of armour</b> : Not much use as real armour and a pain to move, but damn they look great in your home! 
1,<b>Fine furniture</b> : It may be a pain to move. But finely polished and made, it's great around the house. Its also useful to have these things full of secret compartments, so if your house gets looted your quite likely to be able to keep some things secret! 
1,<b>A matched set of exotic jewellery</b> : like a ruby or jade, etc. This would be a cool little item to put in a PC's cabinet. 
1,<b>Portrait Shield</b> : Centuries ago, a young knight named Laynor was so enamored with his beautiful queen he had her portrait painted upon his shield. Upon spying the shield in combat, the king, enraged with jealousy, had the knight executed on the spot. The queen, hearing of the knight's bravery in combat and his devotion to her, had the knight buried with his shield. 
1,<b>A statue made of dragon horn ivory</b> : 
1,<b>A painting </b> :with the true will of a dead king hidden in its frame which would give the right to rule to a distant relative of the current king. 
1,<b>A chess board </b> :made of pure silver with miniaturized petrified adventures as pieces. 
1,<b>A rug/carpet</b> : made of golden fibres. 
1,<b>A set of three golden paint brushes</b> : (magic brushes that would be fought over by the best artists in the world). 
1,<b>A necklace</b> : of dire rat teeth (I would make it give the PC a +2 to disease saves and to the toughness feat). 
1,<b>actual map</b> :, with landmarks noticed with a knowledge check. 
1,<b>Jewelry Box</b> : Turquoise dolphins bordered in gold filigree leap from a lapis lazuli seascape on the ivory panels of this fine jewellery box. The box is two hands long by one hand deep and one hand wide and is enchanted to block perception (the contents can't be scried). The two side panels feature dolphins with fish in their mouths. Depressing the fish on both sides allows the upper and lower halves of the box to rotate so that they can be pulled apart into two separate boxes. The lid of the bottom box is trapped with an obsidian razor blade on the join where one would place a thumb to open the box. 
1,<b>Folk Art </b> : Hukuls Houses in a neighbouring culture feature an unusual form of painted art known as a hukul. A length of rope one or two fingers wide is first wound into a flat spiral. The circle of rope is held in place by running a long, thin pin through it, so that it resembles an O with a bar through the middle. Then the rope is treated with a mixture of mostly secret ingredients (the sap of a local tree is known to be part of the recipe) to ensure that the rope stays flat. <BR><BR>Artists paint intricate, brightly-coloured patterns on the spiral of rope and often on the pin. The more intricate the design, the more valuable the piece. Hukul trends have briefly featured two or more holding pins and portraits or landscapes instead of patterns. Rural homes often have several small, home-made hukuls painted with blessings or homilies. 
1,<b>Handicrafts</b> : of a particular region famed for that craft. Carpets from Isfahan, brocades from Mosul, Japanese lacquerware ... we have lots of real-world examples of items that are held to be special because they come from a particular place. Usually this is because the item is rare or difficult to produce, and thus in low supply, and the item is truly beautiful. <BR><BR>Your world could be made richer by identifying "signature" crafts with the different regions of the world. Sample items: Carpets and rugs, Tapestries, Textiles, Pottery, Metalware, Jewellery, Statuettes and Figurines, and Masks. <UL><LI>Challenge #1: identify the item correctly, to know its true worth. <LI>Challenge #2: these items are often bulky. How to transport them? And how to keep bandits and such from taking them, because they are quite obvious and obviously valuable? </UL>
1,<b>Icons, Relics, and other religious items</b> : Many artworks are made for religious purposes. They are valuable for their beauty, but even more valuable to those of the faith that created them. Having the PCs discover lost icons, idols, priestly vestments and gear and the like and turning them over to those of the proper religion could net great rewards, fame, and friendship. <BR><BR>Sample Items: Icons and paintings, Statuary, Priestly vestments, Cups and bowls used in ceremonies, Sacrificial knives, Bells, Masks. <BR><BR>Challenge: find out the story behind the item, which may lead to more adventures; decide how to dispose of the item - sell it, restore it to the local temple or flock, turn it over to the authorities (if the religion or the icon is somehow banned), etc.? 
1,<b>Lost Masterpieces</b> : Famous artists from the past may have left behind works which are now lost. Collectors will pay enormous sums to acquire such lost masterpieces - provided you can guarantee their authenticity. <i>Challenge</i>: identify the work and its creator correctly, to know its true value; find out who to sell it to. 
1,<b>Three Pieces by Gwyndallion</b> : On an old scroll of purple papyrus there are three songs written down in golden letters by the famous bard himself! Not only that this manuscript alone must be worth a fortune, two of the three songs are not known to the ears of others yet (one of them is rather bad though...)! 
1,<b>Draconic chess set</b> : This sets' board is made of the leather scales of dragons, the black squares from a Black dragon, and the white squares from a white dragon. The pieces are carved from the appropriate dragon's teeth. (Can also be used for other games like checkers.) 
1,<b>Gilt Spectacles </b> : Stylish (if perhaps outdated) spectacles formed of a mithril-gold alloy. If found with intact lenses, worth 300 gp. If found with broken or missing lenses, worth 200 gp. In any event, the spectacles are suitable as the material for crafting any appropriate magic item. 
1,<b>Ducal Chandelier</b> : Formed of crystal, silver, and brass, this chandelier is lovely but huge and heavy. (It's five feet in diameter and weighs 700 pounds.) It's worth 2500 gp. It has sconces for many heavy candles (adding another 150 pounds to the weight when full), but is more commonly used in magical worlds with continual flame spells and a black velvet drop-cloth (for dimming). 
1,<b>Unicorn harp</b> : This harp's strings are made of hair from the mane of a unicorn. 
1,<b>Silver Die</b> : A roughly fist sized solid silver 6 sided dice with golden dotted indents. Surely a reward for any follower of good luck or the dice. 
1,<b>An antique tome</b> : bound in the hide of a dragon, handwritten with fine calligraphy and beautiful paintings. This is the original version of famous theatre-plays written over 500 years ago by the great playwrite Salidan Quintellus. The plays where commissioned for Queen Arianha III. 
1,<b>A small box</b> : filled with seeds of a rare tree, that will produce some of the sweetest fruits imaginable, if one can cultivate it properly. When the tree blooms, it will be totally covered in sweet-smelling white flowers. 
1,<b>Seven Stars of the Rainbow</b> : These are a matching set of seven large gemstones, about the size of a soccer ball, cut into the shape of a starburst, or "Spiky Ball"... resembling a three dimensional compass rose ("*"). The gems were selected by color, each being a different one- Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet. A full or partial set is worth significantly more than the sum of each gem's individual worth. 
1,<b>Unicorn Painting Set</b> : A compact roll of quality leather with several interior pockets that house a set of paint brushes. Each brush has a finely smoothed handle, crafted from ivory and contains the insignia of a unicorn head. A small gem is embedded on each side, representing the Unicorn's eyes. Each brush head contains very soft bristles of a pretty white color. The brushes have a slight odor of.... horse? These sets are said to be illegal in some parts of the land. 
1,<b>Scarab Flasks</b> : A copper container fashioned into the likeness of a horned beetle, roughly the size of a man's hand. The scarab's head can be twisted off with some applied force. Rumors say that these flasks were used long ago by priests to store healing liquids. 
1,<b>Long-Stemmed Metal Rose</b> : Leaves and stem are made from a green-ish metal (electrum?) and the petals of the rose are comprised of dragon scales (your choice in color). Great for selling, or disassembling for use as spell components, but beware of angry artists if destroyed! ("You took it apart and used it for WHAT??") 
1,<b>Dragon Heart Wine</b> : The bottle was so old the label was dirty to the point of unrecognition, plus the fact that it came from a couple of continents away. Its stopper was made of platinum and the glass was dark maroon. A clinking could be heard inside, which was from the 200gp bloodstone (bloodstones are relatively cheap, and this one is quite large, and meticulously shaped into a perfect sphere (if they were to break the bottle and get it). Worth 110,000gp. 
1,<b>No Wheel</b> : The party discovers something that may be difficult or impossible to transfer, but shows ingenious design. Such as non-magical ways to provide running water, central heating, insulation, concrete. Realize the value, duplicate elsewhere => someone gets rich. 
1,<b>Personal items</b> : Not like clothes or the like, but one of my characters (female) let the guys in the party take the gold and gems and she raided the dressing room of the sorceress they had killed. Things like perfume/cologne, fancy clothing (I know I said not clothing), makeup/hair things, shoes- someone's luggage can be just as fun as someone's safe. 
1,<b>An amateurishly rendered oil portrait</b> : of an unknown wizard: On closer inspection, the scroll the wizard is holding in the portrait actually contains a complete spell (DM's choice, choose to suit campaign concept and party levels). Apparent Value: 50 gold. Actual Value: 1,000-15,000 gold (varies per spell). 
1,<b>A small velvet bag containing a crystal sextant</b> : Of magical manufacture, but has no magical properties except accurate craftsmanship. Possible positive DM to navigation attempts. Value: 4,000 gold. 
1,<b>Dolls of the PCs</b> : In FFIX, you could collect action figures of characters in the game itself. Like there was a Queen Brahne, and later on you could actually get an item called the "Mini-Brahne" which was an action figure of her. If the PCs are famous enough, wouldn't it please them to see that action figures, or at least dolls of them have been made and hoarded as "treasure?" Or used as voodoo dolls... 
1,<b>Magazines</b> : In FFVIII, you could collect a set of magazines in the game and actually read snippets from them. How about including campaign newsletters as part of the treasure, like a limited edition magazine or newspaper? It would certainly be rare, almost as rare as most books and tomes of those time, and it would be something that the PCs can interact with. 
1,<b>Games</b> : It's common to find gold or platinum chess sets, but how about finding a set of small papers with numbers on them, a board featuring several nearby locations, several crafted figurines and a bunch of "chance" cards? That's right, a Monopoly set! Granted, they may not have had those in ancient times, but the PCs could find such a set and popularise it in their campaign world. 
1,<b>Cards</b> : In FFVIII (all right, my sources of inspiration are quite limited) there was a card game where you could collect rare cards from defeating bosses or defeating opponents, much like Magic: The Gathering. There was also a card game in the Might & Magic series, but you couldn't collect the cards there. How about letting the PCs find valuable cards in a treasure trove? Maybe it's a game only mages play, and other mages would even kill to obtain those cards... 
1,<b>Porn</b> : As distasteful as it may sound, it would be quite hilarious to have the PCs come upon the villains' stash of porn, wouldn't it? And on the black market, who knows how much it could fetch? 
1,<b>Dice</b> : A set of valuable dice in the villains' horde? Maybe the villain was a compulsive gambler, or maybe the dice are cursed. Nevertheless, just scooping the dice off the table and presenting it to the PCs as their treasure will certainly shock them for a little while. 
1,<b>Musical scores</b> : Like in the article mentioned, musical scores certainly fetched a lot of money. And magical tunes would fetch even more... like perhaps the score of a siren's song? The score of a satyr's pipe tunes? A bard would certainly prize these. 
1,<b>The Green Robin Headboard</b> : Giant birds are not particularly common, so it is an incredible thing to see an eagle sized Green Robin. This beady eyed terror to all worm kind, this magnificent beast was brought down by magic and has been preserved by dark magic. Affixed to a large wooden headboard etched with worms and scenes of grass, the giant Green Robin sits making an interesting (if somewhat macabre) conversation piece. 
1,<b>Bejeweled Dwarven Tavern Signs</b> : Dwarves the great miners of the earth hold precious metals as somewhat more common than other races, as such to see signs etched with gold or silver and gems inlaid on them can be occasionally found on the most important and expensive places in some of the great dwarven cities. Of course these signs would be worth a good sum outside the caverns of the dwarves and as such it would be a truly great prize to have a bejeweled Tavern Sign covered in large dwarven script hung over your mantle piece. However finding, let alone stealing something so obvious would be difficult, but the reward is more than reflected in the prestige a thief would get by owning something like this. 
1,<b>A well detailed tapestry map. More value can be added if there are areas or objects on the map not otherwise documented. 
1,<b>Portrait of a Famous Deceased Adventurer</b> :, as painted by a lesser artist of the day, painted on canvas and mounted in a broad oaken frame.. As a piece of art, it's worth maybe 200 gp at most. It becomes a lot more valuable if you take it out of its broad oak frame and discover that, on the bottom, the Adventurer is holding a map. This map may be copied and does, in fact, lead to a dungeon. 
1,<b>A pair of matched drinking mugs</b> : These are made out of hardwood, covered in leather made from a wild boar's skin, and the handles are made of his tusks. Each would be worth about 20 gp, but as a matched pair, they might go for 50gp total. 
1,<b>A tapestry</b> : depicting a famous local battle. It may be worth only 50 gp in terms of materials, but its historical value may make it worth as much as 250 gp to a collector of such items, or a historian. 
1,<b>3' tall statue of artillian red marble</b> : It is a miniature version of the 30' high cult statues that inhabit the temples and shrines throughout ancient Artillia. The statue is a representation of the ancient goddess Melira, the goddess of sacrifice, love, and compassion. <BR><BR>It is a finely detailed wrap-around sculpture (meaning it is interesting to look at from all angles and not just the front, sorry I forgot the technical term) of a beautiful woman, with a sad face and tears running down her round cheeks. She is garbed in the tattered mantle and cassock of her priestesses. <BR><BR>The cassock is fitted with a simple bronze buckle, the only adornment that intrudes upon the lush red marble. Though it is not fancily adorned, its use (as a head-piece to a shrine) and its materials make it worth at least 10000 Imperial marks. <BR><BR>It is said that if one has one of these sculptures in their house, facing the door, it will bring blessings from the Lady of Compassion.
