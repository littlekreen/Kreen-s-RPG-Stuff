#Unusual Items
;Start
1,<b>Fine cigars</b> : Hopefully the orcs will get you before the tar does, but these cigars just say that you've gotten somewhere, when you smoke one. The feeling of grandeur should probably last awhile and leave the character with a feeling of impunity and a bonus to save verses attacks on the mind or attempts to control it. 
1,<b>Lead lighting</b> : Don't take windows for granted. Most people just use shutters. But if you can find some lead lighting or someone who can make it (Grateful people you've saved), it just makes your house look great! If you can get an image of yourself and your buddies built into the glass, it's even better! 
1,<b>Pommel Gems </b>: Mostly for the look of it, these can be affixed to bottom of the sword/axe handle. GMs might also want to take this into account if the player bops someone with said handle, later on! 
1,<b>A set of tablets</b> : containing the "true" story of how the world was created. (this could be the fabled tablets of the Gods or just a fake.) 
1,<b>A set of tea dishes</b> made of a rare plant that is heat resistant and can be shaped into objects without killing the plant (ideal for Elves and Druids.) 
1,<b>A set of clothes</b> that are reversible (one side is blue the other is red.) Or alternately is like some modern cars changes color depending on where the character stands (usually its a group of closely related colors blue, blue- green, green, yellow-green, and yellow for example.) 
1,<b>A hammer and anvil</b> of extreme masterwork (the blacksmithing equivalent of a +5 great sword). 
1,<b>Wooden Bestiary</b> : A complete set of hand-carved miniature beasts of all kinds (dragons, manticore, owlbears, etc). You can place the set in one place, or scatter them to four winds. You can even make them popular collector's items (ala beanie babies) and everybody wants one. 
1,<b>Wolf tooth knuckles</b> : Essentially your basic knuckles where the rivets consist of wolves' teeth.
1,<b>Alternatively, a wrist spike</b> :  where the spike is the tooth of a large predator such as a dragon or similar. You could take a game card set or some very rare paintings in a small box from a famous painter or player. In the next city there could be someone who is really crazy about these things. Or a group of boys who tell you to pay for being let through or into their hiding place. And you could trade them then. <BR><BR>Maybe the players get to know in the next step of the game, that the painter got kidnapped. When you have something that interesting from a man, you are bound to him to some extend (you could tell them, that he could paint them some more and only for them, because those are the most precious ones! *grin*). So the party goes its way and tries to rescue the guy. 
1,<b>Rune Skeleton Armor</b> :  This ancient bronze banded mail is inscribed with runes and enchantments that sustained it's undead wearer. Though now marred, the runes still seem to describe enchantments of otherworldly perception and supernatural protection.
1,<b>Atlantean Gold</b> :  Similar to common gold, though slightly stronger. Atlantean gold has a reddish hue, making it prized for it's beauty as well as it's rarity.
1,<b>Guardian Naga Pot Pourri</b> :  The ultimate accessory for the evil bathroom, the blue-green scales of the Guardian Naga, when removed and treated, provide the "sweet smell of flowers" for several months. 
1,<b>Dragonsfire</b> :  perhaps the most expensive aphrodisiac in existence, with good reason: the active ingredient is mature red dragon semen! Collecting this ingredient would make an interesting adventure to say the least, bringing a whole new meaning to the skill animal handling... 
1,<b>Humanoid body art</b> :  Orcs could be into tattoos in a big way. Now imagine an orcish Michelangelo, who travels around orc tribes spreading his work. Perhaps he could become quite collectible and his works could be valuable when separated from their owners (ouch!). Of course, you would have to be careful not the damage the work when acquiring it. 
1,<b>If the treasure is found in a hoard</b> : , you might find them preserved in unlabelled jars: Roots, Leaves, Bark, Seeds, Blossoms, Pollen, Mushrooms and Fungi, Shellfish and other sea creatures, and Animals and animal parts. Challenge: Many of these "organic" treasures will be found in wilderness, not in dungeons. Only characters with the proper knowledge can identify and gather them, and/or know how to preserve and transport them. Can you say, this is a job for the ranger?
1,<b>Blood and other body fluids</b> :  The blood and body fluids of legendary or magical creatures may have useful magical properties. <BR><BR>A quick list of fluids that might be valuable might include: Blood, Bile, Musk, Venom, Saliva, Stomach juices, Tears. Some fluids might grant eternal youth, or invulnerability to metal weapons, etc. In the Niebelungenlied, the blood of Fafner the dragon gives Siegfried the ability to understand animal speech. Challenge: how to preserve and transport the fluid? How to use the fluid correctly? Perhaps improper use is fatal or dangerous - the fluid may be poisonous, combustible, corrosive, spawn monsters (remember the movie Clash of the Titans?), etc. 
1,<b>Eggs and Eggshells</b> :  Remember the Sinbad movie where Sinbad has to get a roc's eggshell to make an alchemical formula? And I'm sure anybody can find a use for the egg of a wyvern, or a dragon... Challenge: the nest, of course, is guarded. 
1,<b>Skullcups</b> :  A collection of (rather large) cups made of the skulls of a variety of long dead beasts and monsters. They have ornaments made of silver wire all over them. The gems that were fixed to the skulls eyes, resembling the beasts' pupils, were broken out a long time ago and only a few have resisted all attempts to remove them. A 'must-have' for every barbarian expecting guests! 
1,<b>Argent Horn</b> :  An old ram's horn with a large crack down one side, covered entirely with silver (now tarnished). Has a steel bracket attached to it, enabling it to be used as a (wall-mounted) candle sconce.
1,<b>Satyr's Honey</b> :  A squat, hexagonal, clay, one-pint jar of honey stopped with a yellow painted cork. The liquid has a deep rose tint to it and is laced with cinnamon. 
1,<b>Runic Wood</b> :  As stated this lengthy piece of timber is intricately carved with the runes of the high dwarvish alphabet. Appearing to be made out of the dull pinkish brown Terus Immpyros wood it is resistant to flame and is easily large enough to be propped up above the fireplace. The fiery swirls of the polished grain offsetting the jagged runic letters of the High Dwarven Alphabet. 
1,<b>Coffee</b>
1,<b>Cool Mug</b> :  A mug made out of an arctic metal or remorhaz scale and which keeps its content pleasantly cold. Great for always drinking cold beer!
1,<b>Phosphorescent stone</b> :  This rare type of stone absorbs and stores light or other sources of energy and then releases this energy as a greenish glow when in a lightless environment. The phosphorescent stone sheds light in a 10' radius. 
1,<b>Henyan Spices</b> :  These spices, in addition to being worth a fortune, are so strong they confer anyone who eats them (alone or in conjunction with a meal) a bonus against poison for the next hour. 
1,<b>Mariam Honor Blade</b> :  An unenchanted long sword made from tempered steel, with a gold/silver mix for the handle carved into the shape of a lions head at the pommel, this blade was given for a single year to the champion of the Royal Tourney. Etched into the length of the blade in a tongue long forgotten are mysterious looking runes, the only word of which can be pronounced by local scholars is "Mariam" which means "Honor". These are not magical, and merely translate to the following poem: "Let those who are in favour with their stars, Of public honour and proud titles boast, Whilst I, whom fortune of such triumph bars, Unlook'd for joy in that I honour most." 
1,<b>Fair Robe, White</b> :  A perfectly white garment made from a silk blend from three different species of spider, this robe will never get dirty, even if splashed with mud or tar. This is not from enchantment, but rather a physical attribute of the material itself. A treasure a King, or High Priest might pull out on special occasions if he/she wishes to make a strong impression. 
1,<b>Fair Robe, Colored</b> :  As above, except enchanted during its weaving in order to take dye of any color. If very few White Fair Robes were made, due to the difficulty and length of time involved in making them, the colored versions are even rarer. The colors will be absolutely pure, without any mixture from other colors, so only Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black can be used. These colors will appear vibrant, and almost seem to shimmer. After the color has taken to the silk, the enchantment will fade, and the robe will remain "unmagical". It will keep its color, yet still not become dirty in any way. 
1,<b>Fair Robe, Black</b> :  Special mention should be made of the Black Fair Robe. As opposed to shimmering, such as the other three colored robes do, it will appear to suck in all the light around it, reflecting nothing. Thus, it will seem to be a worn shadow, and may assist in concealment. The only Black Fair Robes that were made, were made by assassins to help them hide in the shadows. Only the most powerful and skilled assassins will ever be allowed to use it. 31. Santeel: Imagine something between sand and steel. It's very rough but it does not crumble, it's very hard but not plastic at all. It's dark grey in colour and is only found in cold volcanos. It is said that it takes a dragon's strength to break santeel, but once it is broken it's useless, because if santeel is melted, the produced material can be broken with bare hands. <BR><BR>Santeel can never be made shiny, it's always twice as rough as sharkskin, and there is NO way to work it into a certain form. That's why santeel weapons and armour are much more rare than the material itself. The piece has to naturally have the needed form (i.e., a sword blade) and you have to be able to put a suitable handle on it. <BR><BR>A sword from santeel would be very tricky to handle - it would just lack a cutting edge (except in very rare cases, which makes the blade unique). On the other hand an armour piece, which permanently has a filing effect on the attacker's weapon is really interesting indeed... 
1,<b>Water silver</b> :  A metal with the properties of ordinary gold, which has the colour of pure silver when looked at through water: "Silvery raindrops were running down his golden breast plate". 
1,<b>A cloak trimmed with fur from the pelt of a krenshar</b> :  Sure, it looks stylish, but other krenshar are not gonna be real pleased when they smell it. 
1,<b>Spider Silk Rope</b> :  This 50 foot coil of rope is made by drow weavers. They must wear gloves woven of the same spider silk and treated with Universal Solvent to remove the stickiness in order to handle it properly. It maintains some stickiness and grants a +2 material bonus to Climb and Use Rope checks. It weighs only 8 lbs per 50 feet. 
1,<b>Mandrake Root</b> :  A bizarrely exotic herb used in the most powerful alchemical concoctions, enormously prized by alchemists. It can be used, in the right recipe, for everything from mind-enhancing concoctions to killer poisons. Usually found around basilisks. 
1,<b>Ember Flowers</b> :  Flowers known to grow on the graves of the mighty; mystical borderlines between the living and the dead. Often used in raising and resurrection spells. 
1,<b>Graymold</b> :  A bland-looking, bitter-tasting, flat-gray mold, often hard to find because it blends with the coarse granite it's known to grow on. Found only in deep, dank caves, the stuff is a powerful healing and purifying agent, used often for both healing flesh wounds and disease. 
1,<b>Silveroak</b> :  A spectacularly rare tree that is the silver lining on any cloud of a deep, deadly forest. It towers like the tallest oak and its branches are stronger than most any other tree in the world. Any bow or wooden tool made from the tree counts as +1 to attack and damage, on top of any additional bonuses.
1,<b>Platinum bar (or any other metal)</b> :  A strange disease, not readily identifiable, accompanies this metal (known in later years as radiation poisoning). Those who carry or are in constant close proximity to it must make a Fortitude check each week, with a DC equal to the number of weeks of exposure. The DC can be increased or decreased depending on the danger desired. Those who fail the check begin taking CON damage (NOT temporary) due to the rotting disease. Their flesh literally begins to turn to mulch, etc. 
1,<b>Gloranthan Copper</b> :  A strange copper-like metal that is ideal for forging armor and weapons of all sorts. Found in bars or ancient equipment or mined, the copper is reddish and melts at a cooler temperature than normal copper, yet is harder still when completely cooled (comparable to iron). It's more resilient to elements (except heat) than normal copper. 
1,<b>Snowy white cloak</b> :  woven from a Unicorn's mane. 
1,<b>Salve (no magical properties)</b> :  which repels stinging insects. 
1,<b>Sun Stones</b> :  These look somewhat like gold, but gain a slightly more translucent and mellowed hue of yellow and usually take the shape of palm-sized skipping stones. For each hour they are exposed to direct sunlight, they can produce 10 minutes of light as bright as an oil lamp, prompted by vigorous rubbing. Each stone can hold 3D6x10 minutes worth of sunlight. 
1,<b>Paper, High Quality</b> :  The sheets in this heap of paper are very thin, and yet as strong as any non-magical sheet. They weigh less than 1/20 of contemporary paper. 
1,<b>Marked Money</b> :  A sizable quantity of gold coins that have an ominous, reddish tinge to them. Each surface of the coins has been minted / carved / marked with faces of demons, symbols of evil rulers, words in monster cants, pictures of vile acts etc. Each coin is also of an unusual shape. Large denomination ones are perhaps gems with engraved metal bands around then. Tetrahedron coins, spherical coins, triangular ones.. options abound, and depend on the beliefs and symbolism of the area. <BR><BR>This cash is Hell Gold. It is well known in the area. It is reputed to be cursed, and using, even possessing any is very illegal. Anyone trying to trade in it marks himself as a villain or worse. As a result, unless the coins are reclaimed from some truly wicked source, they are not stored away as treasure. Some may have been thrown away as trash. Some may have been used in religious ceremonies or ornaments to scare people. And yet they are coins, as well as gold. The reddish tinge (gold-copper alloy?) can be removed by a skilled metallurgist. Some money changers may accept hell gold, though of course at a significantly reduced rate.. and in some circles, Hell Gold is the preferred, or even the only accepted currency. Money can have a story of its own. Less exotic options abound, groups that trade only or preferably in certain kinds of currency. Money with plot hooks. 
1,<b>Sword of Steel...or Steel as Sword?</b> :  An item with multiple meanings. Someone may see the Sword of Wolfgaard as a unique relic with political significance...just the thing to give to the ambassador of the current rulers of Wolfgaard to seal an alliance or secure a pact, which is why the king's agents seek to acquire it by hook or by crook. <BR><BR>For another, it is simply a weapon. Yet another sees in it the odd design, which hints at the legendary swordsmith Graedel, so the blade may have been made by one of his apprentices, yet there is other influences to its design as well, which may shed light to the fate of Graedel. <BR><BR>For someone else, the sword is a key - both a map and a key in the literal sense - to the lost keep of Wolfgaard. It may be seen as the sign for people of Wolfgaard that the time to throw away the yoke of oppressors has arrived. And yet another finds it odd that the blade is effective in battle though the blade does not appear to be sharp. Perhaps this is due to its enchantments.. or its material.. or the combination of the two.. so taking it apart is necessary. Combine any two roles for a single piece, and it becomes much more than just a sword.
1,<b>A polished wooden case</b> :  containing silkworm eggs, mulberry seeds, and a treatise on the production of silk. Value: Nearly infinite to a culture which does not produce its own silk. Risk to PCs: A culture which has a monopoly on the silk trade will take extreme measures to protect its monopoly. 
1,<b>The PC's who normally use block and tackle to make fire</b> : , find it's a very uncomfortable way of making fire taking them some minutes. Suddenly, they encounter a little box filled with little sticks with a funny thing in one end, out of curiosity, they rub it and it lights up!! now they treasure a box of matches more than their dagger+5 because it makes fire faster than they ever thought. 
1,<b>Salamander Egg Tea Cups</b> :  8 cups that never allow the heat to radiate out or burn the drinker. I ran a game where the climax had the party discover a dragon's egg incubating in lava. When the egg hatched, one of the party kept the pieces. We never did anything with them, but anything that can hold off lava could coat the space shuttle. 
1,<b>Lantern Stone</b> :  This material is thought to be a by- product of volcanic eruptions, as deposits of it are often mined from the slopes of long-dormant volcanos. It breaks easily into rough one inch cubes. If it allowed to soak for eight hours in a pint of lantern oil, chemicals in the stone enhance the oil's burning property. It increases the light output of the flame from the oil by about a third (a common lamp will illuminate 20 ft radius, a hooded lantern will illuminate a forty foot radius, and a bull's-eye lantern's cone will be about 27 feet at the end and extend to 80 feet.) The oil lasts the same amount of time. Once a stone has enhanced 10 pints of oil, the chemicals that cause the enhancement are too diluted to do further good. It has no discernible effect on Greek fire. One stone typically fetches about 5 gp and weighs one pound. 
1,<b>Technology</b> :  that the characters don't know how to use (preferably harmless, unless you are a particularly mean GM ;). They players typically will say: "cool a Gatling gun, I'll point it at the bad guys and pull the trigger". This is a bad idea if they don't even know which way the gun is supposed to point. "A huge terrifying racket rings out and when the smoke clears the orcs are still charging you down, looking behind, you notice that the wizard is lying on the ground soaked in blood".
1,<b>Patent notices</b> :  If the world is bureaucratic enough then this notice could make the character very rich going around the country and suing everyone that put a parapet on the top of their castle walls. 
1,<b>Technology Blueprints</b> :  better ways to mix metals -better ways to mine and refine - finding an uninhabited plane - training. 
1,<b>What's better than stretching</b> : out before a roaring fire on a bearskin rug? How about stretching out on a rug made from the luxurious pelt of an owlbear? Sure they're foul- tempered and mean, but, when their hides are properly cured by an expert Tanner (DC 30 to get it just right), they embody all the softness and thickness of down with the warmth and size of bearskin. A well-made owlbear-skin rug could fetch as much as 200gp easily, maybe 300gp if a taxidermist stuffs the head and leaves it attached. 
1,<b>For the higher tech RPGs out there such as Shadowrun</b> :  Ammo. Do you know how hard it is to get armor piercing ammo? Perhaps the fence you usually use is fresh out of cash, but he's got two clips of the best ammo known to man. <b>Big guns</b>: Maybe the ghoul nest you take out (or make a deal with) has been holding on to this heavy machine gun....oops, where are you going to get heavy machine gun ammo? <b>SOTA cyberware</b>. Great, you've just "liberated" the paydata, and someone found a nifty sealed case on the way out. Perhaps it has the new cranial tactical computer that'll really give your team the edge....who's going to install it? 
1,<b>A Clock</b> :  Rare mechanical device, treasure that always knows what time it is. Brittle. 
1,<b>An exclusive modern-day set of kitchen knives</b> :  High quality. Limited combat use though. 
1,<b>Guardian Angel</b> :  These armors are extremely rare and are found almost exclusive at the hands of great military leaders or extremely rich collectors. For these armors are truly a gift from the heaven. The metal used to create these armors comes from the metals that have merged when meteors have smashed the earth. <BR><BR>Some call it Mithrill and fancies the dwarven smiths who are the only who can manage such metals. Nevertheless, a Guardian Angel isn't just the hardest, most resistant armor in the world, it's also the most beautiful, many say. In sunlight it shines of glory and many soldiers have been inspired by its wearer to fight glorious battles before he dies. <BR><BR>One of the most extraordinary features of the Guardian Angel, is its lightness. You could wear a full plate created of Mithrill and it would feel like wearing a leather armor. But due to the dwarven magic used to create such wonderful armors, it also makes it impossible to cast spells in such armors. It simply can't be done. 
1,<b>Druskan drinking horn</b> :  Straight from the deeper Kuri Steppes, this drinking horn is made from the tusk of the Drahza beast, the beast that all Druskan boys must hunt to achieve their coming of age. The Horn itself is of a fabulous bleached white. As it continues to taper it also spirals around, the horn can be set on any flat surface due to this natural spiraling of the Drazha beast. It is said this was the drinking horn of Kudras himself, quite a legendary figure in Druskan folklore. Its brim is fitted with a bronze ring, which is connected to a bronze inlay that stretches across the horn's surface in the shape of fingers of fire. An assortment of gems is also encrusted within the blaze. The value of this horn is at least 4000 Imperial Marks but its current owner, Marius Kohan, refuses to sell no matter the price. 
1,<b>Axehead, stone</b> :  This head for a woodcutter's axe was made a few thousands years ago. It is quite fragile compared to iron or steel, made of flint as it is.
