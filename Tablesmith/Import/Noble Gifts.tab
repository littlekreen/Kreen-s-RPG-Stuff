#Gifts from Nobility
;Start
1,<b>A useless title</b> - You have just been named Keeper of the Rose of Florin with all the rights and privileges hereto attached. Could be made up by the king on the spot. 
1,<b>A slave boy/girl</b> - might be really tricky if the players are supposed to not be into that sort of thing. How do you not become a slaver and not offend the local king? 
1,<b>A sculpture</b> made from relatively cheap material (brass, wood, clay) but commemorating the PCs victory over a certain beast or completion of a great service. 
1,<b>Music box</b>: This music box releases butterflies once/day (perfect gift for a princess). 
1,<b>The banner of victory A banner/flag/standard</b> that is always stretched out evenly, no matter how much wind is present. 
1,<b>A Lady's Favor</b>: A silk scarf, handkerchief, or something more intimate scented with a lady's perfume and given as a sign of her affection and gratitude. "This scarf was a gift to me from the Queen of America!" 
1,<b>Titles with catches</b>: Imagine the player's joy at getting this new title. Now imagine when the learn the catch - they have a border to protect, or are expected to marry a certain person, or the land was made barren by a curse. 
1,<b>"Karai-Natatak"</b>. That's a title, given by the town's folk of certain cities to the person who has proven to have travelled a really, Really, REALLY long distance away from the city in question. It's very respectable, too. And you loose it if you stay in the city for more than 24 hours. "Sleep on it" gets a new meaning here. 
1,<b>Treasure-quest switcheroo</b>: A relatively simple quest brings the party great glory. As a result, the party leader is given a lesser noble title and expected to marry the daughter of the aristocrat employer. The marriage is the real mission. Maybe the marriage is the daughter's idea; she took a fancy for the noble hero and asked her father to set up a marriage. <BR><BR>Or the quest is a test, and the idea is to get her out of the way of an assassination (or at least get her a good protector). Or there are other, less obvious reasons why the employer wants to set up a marriage between the hero and his child, like preventing her from marrying someone else, to hide an embarrassing pregnancy (I wonder what the father of the child will do?)... or she may be a hellion and her father has just had it with her, ending up in harsh words and "I'll marry you off to the next available man who walks through that door!" 
1,<b>The Dungeon is the Treasure</b>: Brought down by treachery, deceit, and a brief siege, the Castle of Highwatch was captured almost intact by barbarian king Kovach some fifty years ago. A zealot on a mission, he set fire to the central keep and continued his crusade. The damage done by the fire was mainly cosmetic, however. The castle yet stands, and is almost intact. Supplies and a few months of work would make it defensible, and in two years it could be made nearly impregnable, a stronghold watching over the unruly lands, a haven along the King Road. <BR><BR>Its current monstrous (or brigandic?) inhabitants have made some preparations to enhance the defenses but lack the sophistication, resources, and manpower to do a proper job.. which gives the PCs an opportunity. The party is sent to eliminate the monsters / brigands.. but nothing was said about the castle, which is the employers' (lesser noble? merchant guild? thieves guild?) main objective. <BR><BR>If the castle is cleared and left unoccupied, the employer's agents, a "trade caravan", will soon move in to secure it and in months it will be highly defensible once more. Will the party see the greatest treasure available for what it is? (of course the dungeons can be such also in a more classic sense. Any defensible spot with enough room and a good location is prime real estate, or promotion in rank, or some days off duty or a room of one's own. 
1,<b>Doll Set of (nobles or princesses name here)</b>: This dollset can be found in a nobles house or perhaps in a thieves possession or lair. These little cute dolls act somewhat like ioun stones accept they dance and walk and play following the player on the ground and sometimes flying through the air. They imbue the personality of the player with a +2 charisma and the dolls seem irresistible for little girls to hold. The dolls also give the player a once a week charm person spell. This item can be used for a few different plot hooks. If given to a not so charismatic evil character who likes to hide his alignment, a doll could be snatched up by a little girl and his alignment may prove to be shown after he reacts. 
1,<b>Isle of Koraas</b>: The Isle of Koraas is a small island fiefdom located only a few miles offshore. The island itself once held a small thorp, but humanoid invaders took it over several years ago and wiped out the villagers. They now occupy the small keep on the island. A noble can grant title to the land to a PC, which means that the PCs can have a base of operations from which to work. But before the PCs can use the land, they, of course, must clear it of the invaders first, thus saving the noble from having to do it himself. 
1,<b>Hereditary Title "Esteemed Benefactor" of city</b>. This title grants no specific privileges but adds the character(s)' name to the list of pillars of the town. It may occasionally win a free ale or discounted armor. 
1,<b>Promissory note from the Earl of Highsbury</b>. This document promises the payment of 100 gold pieces on the presentation of it to the Earl of Highsbury.
1,<b>Ownership documents to a bridge</b>, with a licence to collect tolls if held intact and if Kings messengers etc can pass for free. The bridge itself may be ruined. 
1,<b>Seal of an unimportant office</b>. If offered for sale, it will attract many suspicious individuals claiming to be collectors and offering large sums of gold. 
1,<b>The right to pay only half the taxes</b> if working in some strange profession,or performing some ridiculous ritual regularly.Rich people may pay handsomely for this, but it may earn some enemies among the Kings Collectors. 
1,<b>Crest of Richard the Just (medallion, non-magical)</b>. The Crest of Richard the Just is an oval medallion on a long silver chain. It is forged in an unknow, blue metal with the crest in relief-gold. <BR><BR>The Crest is unique. It is also legendary in the realm of Richard the Just. Citizens of Wellendorn will recognize it on sight and will treat the bearer as they would the King himself. They have been known to carve it's likeness into anything that needed adornment, doors, barn walls, table tops, shields, lids of jars, glass windows...just about anything. Many proud villagers have the Crest tattooed onto their chest or arm as a vow of loyalty to the House of Mortenvale, the ruling family of Wellendorn and the honor guard of the ruling family has it branded into their chests when they become part of the elite guard. <BR><BR>The bearer of the Crest is honored in Wellendorn and treated with respect and generosity. Many warriors have possessed the Crest and all have been welcomed into the halls of Bellemont Castle as honored guests. The Crest has called the King to action to defend unknown foreign lands with his army at the mere suggestion of the bearer. <BR><BR>Anyone carrying the Crest in the realm of Wellendorn can expect food, cloths, shelter, supplies, and even help from the royal family. <BR><BR>The Crest of Richard the Just has been missing for a generation and it's location is unknown.
