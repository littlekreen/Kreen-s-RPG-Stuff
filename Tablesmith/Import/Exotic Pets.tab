#BEASTS AND MONSTERS
;Start
1,<b>Exotic pet</b> : brought from over the sea at no small expense by the King, his pride and joy, a Llama! Might be useful, might not.
1,<b>Strange breeds of pets</b> : Rabbits and cats. Cabbits? Dogs and raccoons. Dacoons? Rogs? Could be a lot of money for wizards looking for unusual familiars.
1,<b>Younglings</b> : The result of an attack on a monster's lair might be the discovery of a nest of its young. Baby animals of rare or magical species will definitely be very valuable. Or the character himself might want to try to raise the animal to be a pet or companion. For example, maybe a dire wolf cub can be trained to become the ultimate guard dog; if a character of mine were to find a direwolf cub, I'd certainly try it! Challenge: how do you take care of the little ones?
1,<b>A Willow Wisp within a Diamond</b> : Magically contained within a large square cut diamond (2 gnome fists) in size. This willow wisp forever struggles to be released. Trapped by a malevolent wizard for angering him the wisp, shrunk and bound, struggles to escape, discharging static charges that make the diamond shimmer. Makes for great entertainment for the party - watch the trapped willow wisp hurl itself against the inside of the diamond.
1,<b>A pet</b> : a rare breed of dog, a racehorse, or something, um, *grander* in scale (the term "white elephant" comes to mind). Suddenly, the PC has to take care of a dependent.
1,<b>The Beast is the Treasure</b>. It need not be dead or alive. The hostiles can have special qualities, information, clout, all sorts of things that make them interesting. So what will the group do when ordered to capture a vampire intact? Or to deliver the Dark Elf Matron of the Third House to a specific place at a specific time, alive, helpless, and unharmed? Or to provide the client a unicorn filly? Adult unicorns are rare in the extreme, reproduction not well known, and unicorn foals practically never seen...how about breeding one?
