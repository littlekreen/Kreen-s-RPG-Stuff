#Named Items
;Start
1,<b>Maiden of Illusion</b> : An enchanted copper disk. When activated it creates a beautiful female dancer (Perhaps a belly dancer or other type that suits the region). Some of the more powerful of these devices can project the image anywhere in the room, making this woman seem very life-like. This can impress visitors, who may think the woman is real. It's also just nice to watch, the woman being somewhat like a moving painting. 
1,<b>Ice maker</b> : Actually, this item is probably fairly powerful, given that in real history ice was such a luxury that is was sometimes mined from mountains and carried miles for kings. This magic device slowly produces ice cubes until it fills its decanter (Draws the water from the air). Also helpful for soothing wounds. 
1,<b>Enchanted knife of +3 square meals per day</b> : Not intended for combat at all. It's presumed mages who prefer to keep their head in their books rather than their hands in the kitchen, created these. The knife can magically animate itself and if provided with food stuff, create basic meals (Like sandwiches, etc). It also cleans itself! Only 9.95 plus postage and mishandling of the goblin who owned it previously! 
1,<b>Glow stone (Magic)</b> : Handy for places where you don't have a fireplace or space for a fire. When activated these stones warm up and glow with heat. Though unpleasant to hold for a long time, the rock cannot scald (Can't boil water either). Some people wrap them up in material and sleep next to them to keep them warm during the night. If you own several you can warm a house with them. Some of these stones produce more light than heat, and can be used for lighting purposes (Handy if you don't like going to bed at sunset and don't want oil or firewood costs). 
1,<b>Bedroll/Sleeping bag of anti scorpions and snakes</b> : Think about it! :) 
1,<b>Everburning Tinder</b> : A small pile of twigs and small sticks which, when lit on fire, will continue to burn until doused, never being eaten by the flame. When doused, they are dry and cool to the touch. 
1,<b>A crystal skull</b>  that lights up on command, producing light equivalent to a candle - designed to be an evil cleric's desk lamp. 
1,<b>A cloak and/or boots that resist dirt</b> - they never get dirty. No real game application, but a character embellishment to be sure. 
1,<b>The Glowing Pen</b> : This quill pen, made from the feather of some unidentifiable creature, always writes smoothly and with just the right amount of a black ink. It never runs out of ink. The ink dries immediately and cannot be smudged, but most amazing about this pen is that anything it writes gains a soft glow, not nearly enough to provide a light source but it allows the text to be read in the dark and provides a dazzling effect even in the light. 
1,<b>Soup Bowl</b>  of heating. 
1,<b>A magic dancing doll</b>  (it dances!.... WOW!). 
1,<b>A sewing stick </b> (that creates seams). 
1,<b>A magic compass</b> . 
1,<b>Box of magic fireworks</b> . 
1,<b>Cursed Crown</b> : Seen on display, this crown resembles a black-lipped mouth filled with long, thin, yellow-gold teeth. The band of the crown is made of black metal with a bulge in the middle, as if its creator had formed the band around a rope. The tines are made of an unusual yellow metal, softer and more yellow than gold and faintly "greasy" to the touch. When worn, the crown confers or increases powers of command and causes fear in enemies, even those who dare not oppose the wearer openly. 
1,<b>The living painting</b> : A painting of a landscape in which you can see the grass blowing in the wind, hear the birds chirping and so on. 
1,<b>A magic staff</b>  that fills the one who touches it with bare skin with a desire for a certain item, idea or action (e.g. drinking water, freedom for his or her home country, possession of a special gem, etc.). The person is obsessed by that want until his or her need is fulfilled. The want must be a desire that the person already has, it is then turned into an obsession by the wand. The staff is made of a dark wood and is nearly indestructible. It is said that it was created by a mischievous god. 
1,<b>The bottomless bag</b> : This is a bag that contains a 'mini- dimension'. Virtually everything can be stuffed into it, so that the person carrying it will never have any problems with transporting too many and/or too heavy things! It is a brown bag of unknown fabric. It does not look too fancy. It is unknown where it comes from! 
1,<b>The Ruby Heart</b> : A large glowing ruby in a heart shape. Apart from being quite valuable it is also magical. It should be noted that the Ruby Heart is a religious symbol for a goddess of love in our campaign. The gem, when touched (as found out by embarrassing experimentation), greatly enhanced the libido and fertility of the person touching it, to the point where a couple of the characters got carried away, and now are expecting a child. The prize was worth far more than it's monetary or magical value due to it's significance as a religious relic. Donating it to the appropriate religion gained us a great deal of prestige and goodwill. The point of this example is that often mundane or magical items can be seen as priceless by certain people (and worthless by others). To see modern day examples, think of the Shroud of Turin, or even the Mummies in Egypt. 
1,<b>Secure backpack</b> : A backpack of holding with several pockets on the outside. The pockets have items in them, but each requires a different command word to open. This lets the characters run around to find the treasure they already have. 
1,<b>Frost bottle</b> : Keeps everything cool and icy. 
1,<b>Horn of assassination</b> : Resembles a rhino's horn or that of another creature with horn(s). This horn looks like any other. It's wide at the bottom and ends with a pointy top. It's hollow, so that it can contain liquid and be useful to drink from (or be killed. more on that later). But at the tip it has a secret, tiny room that can contain anything of tiny size. This item is used mostly by assassins and thieves who need to smuggle tiny things (poisonous powder, tiny bottles of acid, etc) into well guarded areas. <BR><BR>It's also very handy when it comes to assassination since it has a mix-function that pours the poisonous powder or the acid into the liquid, making it lethal. This mix-function is triggered by a small button at the tip of the horn (barely noticeable). <BR><BR>These Horns are created by skilled craftsmen, usually working for Assassins or evil wizards, since it is quite hard to craft correctly. The mix-mechanism, for example, often fails if the horn isn't crafted right, and won't pour when the user wants it to or pours when the user drinks of it himself. As said, Horn of assassination is a dangerous item. 
1,<b>Fool's Blade</b> : This mighty weapon, consisting of a pommel, a grip and a guard, is in short words - a sword's handle. Once a noble man, a maniac at arms and armour, received this weapon "with an invisible blade" as a birthday present from his brother, a thief in his toes. On the other day they dueled... and nobility changed hands. It may be funny, but the Fool's Blade has a magical property besides the story: the one who grips it has a great urge to thrust someone with it. Well, it's a crazy world... 
1,<b>Costner's Tin Cups</b> : A half-dozen small, plain, drinking vessels. When grasped firmly in one hand, the user may speak directly into the cup and the speech will be heard through the remainder of the cups, up to a range of 100 yds/level of the creator. Any liquid in the cups may be drunk normally, but communication coming through will sound, well, gargled. 
1,<b>Ever-Filling Mug</b> : Popular (very popular) with the Knights of the Mug, this ornate vessel, when banged on a hard surface, will refill with a good ale every ten minutes. Leads to a lot of banging at the monthly meetings. Won't keep the party alive in a desert forever, but they'll die happy. Do not operate heavy war horses after use. Owners will fight to the death to keep possession ("Your 'Precious'? I'll show you something 'Precious'!"). 
1,<b>Soul Beads</b> : According to rumors, these strange beads are said to provide a good nights rest, even if one does not have a full night in which to rest. Usually the beads are about the size of a pea and colored a silver white. Often they're mistaken for pearls, until one looks closer. If the rumors are to be believed, one must place a bead beneath their bed to gain the benefits of a restful slumber. 
1,<b>Nunchaku of the Dragon</b> : This pair of nunchaku are made of finely polished dragon bones and dyed black. Each stick is stylishly engraved with a different color dragon that winds around it-red, green, silver, and gold. Their enchantment prevents the colors from fading or chipping. Both weapons are enchanted to be +3 to hit and damage, but when they are wielded at the same time they bestow the wielder with the Ambidexterity and Two-Weapon Fighting feats. These feats are only effective while using the weapons during combat. This effect allows one extra attack per round but all attacks during the round suffer a -2 penalty. The penalty lasts until the next round, so any attacks of opportunity made before the next round also suffer the penalty. The weapons can be used individually as regular +3 nunchaku. The weapons radiate moderate evocation magic and moderate transmutation magic. Dam: 1d6+3, Critical: x2, Weight: 2 lb. each, Type: Bludgeoning, Caster Level: 15, Market Price: 50,000 gp 
1,<b>Pen and Inkwell of the Peace Maker</b> : This is the golden pin and inkwell set used by the human Lord Tinyoth to create the first peace treaty between the elves and dwarves in this region. The treaty started the longest period of peace the two groups in the last 2000 years. Regrettably this peace lasted only 87 years. It was ended after an unfortunate incident involving a new dwarven mine near the surface and a sacred elven tree. Could be found in a Wizards room or anywhere writing implements would normally be stored. The local elven and dwarven communities will be very interested in knowing how the PCs got this. 
1,<b>Infinite Quiver</b> : A leather quiver banded with red-etched runes, this container never runs out of arrows so long as someone is not scrutinizing it (in other words, if someone pulls out arrows carefully to see how it works, it will disappointingly run out until refilled). 
1,<b>Ravage Knife</b> : A blood-red knife especially attuned to human flesh. It gains a +3 bonus to attack and damage, but any time it misses, it strikes its wearer. If attacking a nonhuman foe, it gains a -3 bonus to attack and no bonus to damage, with the same user-attacking properties above. 
1,<b>Dwarf Horn</b> : This ivory horn has a unique and highly distinctive note. Anyone that blows this horn on Tuesday becomes physically incapable of knowingly directing any harm (melee, missile, magic) against any dwarf for the rest of the day. 
1,<b>Griffon Wishbone</b> : The wishbone of a griffon has certain special magical properties. If it is carefully removed intact from the carcass and cleaned of all flesh, it can be used to store spells. A given wishbone can store a number of spell levels equal to the creature's hit dice. Spells stored in a wishbone are cast like Sorcery, and can be cast by any magic-user touching the bone that has the ability to cast spells of that class and level. 
1,<b>Arrows of Piercing</b> : Seven green-glowing magical arrows are quite a treasure to be found; they are nearly impossible to destroy, and are suitable for a short bow (composite or normal) only. These arrows ignore all armor, shielding, magical protection, etc. that adds to AC. The only AC bonuses a target gets against the Arrows of Piercing are from Dex and Size. 
1,<b>Monster Chess</b> : A chessboard where the pieces animate whenever used. Much fun to play, voice or thought operated. Alas, the pieces tend to rip each other to pieces and feast on one another; dead pieces only leave a pedestal, and there are no replacements in the box under the chessboard (full set of pieces in the beginning though.. except that there are no rules). Also, the three armies appear to be vastly unmatched - one group consists primarily of lesser fiends, one of orcs and goblins, the third and most powerful one of elven archers, a mage, and a mounted knight. Further, each piece is unique in its features. Real people? Or not? Can they be rescued? Can it be done to the enemies of the party? 
1,<b>Force Piton</b> : This small metal pin has a loop at one end, while the other end is threaded very coarsely. The entire thing is 8 inches long. The tip of the threaded end is covered with a wood or plastic cap. When the cap is removed, the tip can be seen to glow deep orange. <BR><BR>Effect: When the bare, threaded tip is pressed to stone, ice, or any other non-living surface, it sinks in until only the looped end is exposed. After waiting 15 seconds for it to "cure", the piton can not be removed without taking out all the material around it. These serve as handy anchor points for climbing ropes or anything else you need to hang from any surface. Can only be planted once, not removable. 
1,<b>Web strand-in-a-can</b> : This small can measures the size of a very-large permanent marker. The application tip is white and fuzzy. Effect: This dispenser holds up to 200 feet of disposable webbing, which acts as giant spider silk (can hold up to 500 lbs). It can be used as sticky cordage. 
1,<b>Underwear of cleanliness +1</b>  protection (who thinks to take someone's underwear?): This very underwear never dirties on even the biggest ogres business end. It refits itself to any wearers size, and as soon as you and you alone touch it, it resizes to what would fit you best, the color and fabric can be changed by a wizard willing to do so who puts a little effort into figuring out its magics (Identify to find out the ingredients required). This change can be quite useful if a shifty warlord likes his/her dream woman/guy to be wearing one kind of color, after all, even the ignorant general has a favorite color. 
1,<b>Enchanted Boot laces</b> : I don't quite remember what item it was that could extend to long lengths but I'm sure it was a rope and that that rope could hold many pounds. This item can be easily disguised or packaged. It can carry a heavy load, more so than silk rope. This item can be very useful for tieing up any large creature not knowing the command words or gestures to make it change size... and it could be interesting if they messed up such words and cut circulation to said held appendages. 
1,<b>Calendar of Dates </b> (this will have to coincide with DM's calendar if he keeps one): This small glass plate calendar has the ability to set up the players character with a cumulative blind date every week. The first week of holding onto the calendar it will show this month and/or next if needed, also it will set up the player with a random blind date of the characters race or somewhat close to thereof (elf could date a human, dwarf or half-orc...). This first date should be set up to make the player want to return. <BR><BR>Every week there's a new blind date set up for the character, so the second week he'll have two dates, whether on the same or different day. After a while you will notice that every day will be filled up and later on there will be multiple dates for every day (make a max amount to be safe). If the player skips a date, then the next date will be of 'less quality' than his/her last. And if a PC keeps skipping dates, the single blind dates in the neighborhood will definitely start looking for him/her if they miss it, leading to some bad excuses after a while, and soon, mobs of angry people chasing after the lovebird hero. <BR><BR>This calendar seems to have a hard time of getting lost. If thrown away or left somewhere the calendar will simply pop up in a place where the character will see it at eye level. The calendar can't be stolen so a jealous lover of one of the blind dates or a thief with high hopes could get quite angry. Luckily the calendar can be read by anyone of any race or intelligence. <BR><BR>Set up a quest or some other way to remove the curse for those characters who might find it annoying after a while. 
1,<b>Glove of Mutual Understanding</b> : It's best a PC not know what this does after an identify has been made. When this glove is donned on the hand of a hapless PC, it reads the surface thoughts and feelings of the wearer and shows them in motions of the hand, dragging the body to the place where it would be best shown if need be (never causing physical damage in hp's). <BR><BR>A character can make a Wisdom check if they know what the glove does and they're trying to suppress the action to be taken by 'not' thinking about it. Examples of actions being taken could be a snotty noble is being their usual self and the character strolls over to them and slaps them in the face. A drunken warrior comes up to the table and starts hitting on the character, so the PC draws a blade and holds it up to the person's throat quick as lightning. The greedy PC has the slightest moment of pity on the beggar at the side of the road with a broken leg and one eye so he throws his bag of gold at the beggars feet, leading to a tug of war between the two if needed. An evil type character is sitting in on a church sermon so as to spy on a wealthy prospect so the glove flips the priest the bird while the PC is sitting quietly in their seat. 
1,<b>Ogre Sock</b> : This piece of cloth which looks like the year old gym sock of a large humanoid was invented by an annoyed human mage. She didn't much like the sound of a homely bard who pestered her daily outside the tower window so she got creative. When put in the mouth this tasty morsel makes words come out in a mumble of sorts, but tastes like a kings feast enveloping the character with a pallet of many flavors that almost none could resist. It has no nutritional value so any character who tries to replace their food with this will find themselves hungry by the end of the day. This treat cannot be swallowed and it emits a fairly decent scent in about a 5 foot radius leaving the hungry nearby wanting a bit for themselves. 
1,<b>Figurine similar to Wondrous item</b> : When peeled from it's wooden base and set on the ground before the user, the item becomes a full sized variant of that animal/person/thing. Generally the device is under a dweomer that forces it to be 'friendly with' or 'follow one order of' the person who peeled the figure from it's base. I have used this in various forms... An elephant with saddle, A 3rd level human fighter who fights one battle then wanders off to find his home... a 10'x10'x1' stone wall...this was used to block a passageway as the players retreated from a sticky situation, A small fire with fuel for 1 hour, a pile of snakes. The possibilities are endless.... 
1,<b>+1 axe</b> : This blade has an engraving scratched on its blade it looks like a cross followed by a straight vertical line. 
1,<b>Mugs of Neverspilling</b> : The base of these mugs has a sticky rubber-like substance extracted from a Maple tree, that once placed cannot be removed unless twisted in a certain fashion. 
1,<b>Bludgeon sheath</b> : A sheath that fits any sword and acts as a bashing weapon 1d4. 
1,<b>Paper of Magical Correspondence</b>  (sheets of paper, magical). Paper of Correspondence looks like normal, linen paper of fine quality. When a sheet is used for a personal letter from one person to another, addressed to the recipient ("Joel Durnhurst of Jefegurn Springs"), and then lit on fire it will burn quickly and not light anything else in it's vicinity and magically UNBURN in the immediate area of the addressed recipient! That's not all...The recipient can then write a reply on the back of the paper and light it on fire and it UNBURNS in the area of the originator. <BR><BR>This paper is highly sought after by people who cannot afford to keep pigeons for important messages, like battlefield commanders and adventurers. 
1,<b>Crown of Horns</b> . The Crown, made entirely of the spiked horns of humanoid demons, once sat upon the head of Lucia Matak, otherwise known as the Queen of the Damned. Legend has it that Lucia was once a sorceress, learning in our very own Tower of Destinies when she summoned a dozen Zukrai demons (those are the demons that resemble Satrys with a single, slightly curving horn sticking from the top of their head like a unicorn) and offered them a deal they could not refuse. She proposed that if any of them could defeat her in a contest of spell and wit then they could have her soul and the souls of all in her school, but if she won then she could have their power. <BR><BR>The story tells us that they came on her at once but she, only a maiden of 16 at the time, bested them all and then, one by one, drew the horns from their heads with her bare hands. She then became the most powerful sorceress in the known realms. She left the school and began calling an army of the dead, with the addition of the tribes of goblins who came to worship her as a goddess, and the minions of the demons that she had slain. The Crown has an unbelievable value of 1,000,000 for those who believe in its power to call forth the undead, or 15,000 for those who do not.
