#EXOTIC FOODS
#
;Start
1,<b>A huge wheel of Parmesan cheese</b> : The characters will look at it skeptically but it is nutritious enough to keep someone alive for several days with nothing else, and it lasts forever.
1,<b>Fine wine</b> : An excellent wine to toast the victories of the group. Perhaps it will even heal a point or two of damage from the fine feeling of relaxation it imbues to mind and body. Game Hook: The group may find it beneficial to present a fine bottle of wine to a lord or other higher up they are trying to get favour from. However, if you feel like a light hearted adventure, all sorts of wine threatening situations can come up in delivering it, like it rolling towards the edge of high drops, being stolen by drunken kobolds seeking more ale, being lost in a pile of other bottles, etc.  
1,<b>Hunk'o'troll</b> : A resealable jar with a small amount of troll meat in it. Simply uncap, wait a couple minutes, and slice off the regrowing portion and recap. Voila, instant troll patty. And in case you're wondering, though I've yet to try it myself, I'm told the taste of troll is, curiously, not entirely unlike that of common fowl such as chickens. 
1,<b>Troll Berries</b> : Description - Troll Berries look like dull, black olives on the outside. The skin is thin, yet very tough, and can only be cut with a +1 or better edged weapon. Inside, there is a solid, red fleshy substance that is flaky like coconut meat. There is no seed or pit. The berries grow in clusters (4d6 berries) like grapes, limited to 1-3 clusters per bush. The bush grows straight up into 1- 3, 7" tall palm-like stalks, with long, ugly, brown/black fronds. One cluster of berries grow per stalk.<BR><BR>This plant only grows outside in an arid climate, and only on an earthy spot where a troll's blood is spilled (must be the last drops of a dying troll). Troll Berries are sought and hoarded by trolls. Once picked, they dry nicely and keep for a millennium (the berries, not the trolls). Trolls who consume the berries actually grow stronger, tougher, and larger- permanently! Also, for 24 hours after eating the berries, trolls regenerate at double their usual rate!<BR><BR>Eaten straight, Troll Berries are extremely poisonous to most other races (the most dangerous, ingested poison will do, or the DM can make something up) Elves do not get a saving throw, they die instantly after eating one berry. But if handled carefully, they can be an interesting treasure! One berry, crushed and steeped in a large pot of boiling water for 5 minutes, will give up to 8 PCs regeneration for 1d4 hours. All Elves are allergic to this potion and will fall into a coma-like state for 1-4 days. 
1,<b>Piokos (Pee-oh-koes)</b> : Chocolate birds. Like Peeps only chocolate. 
1,<b>The Flaming Onion</b> : A drink that was a best seller in a tavern of the kingdom's barracks and was known throughout the kingdom for having a one drink limit. The recipe was carefully guarded and anyone that got it could use it to black mail the tavern owner, or to sell it to another tavern for big bucks. Although each one would have to have a good story behind it. A secret recipe could tempt even the most honest of parties. 
1,<b>The Shebbrin Cavefish</b> : A prize which is difficult to obtain, difficult to maintain, and difficult to sell, but it could be well worth it. This small fish is a delicate shade of blue, with greyish fins. They can only be found in deep, extensive caverns, in natural pools. The meat is considered rather unpleasant by most peoples, but, for some reason, rock and forest gnomes love them (deep gnomes are unimpressed - they eat them all the time.)<BR><BR>Unfortunately, "shebbies" die quickly when taken out of their natural environment, and their meat starts to spoil almost immediately, so they are difficult to transport to most gnomish settlements. Gnomish PCs can enjoy them as a treat on an adventure in the Underdark, or the PCs could try to figure out how to transport them to the gnomes that love them. Sale price might be as much as 25 gp per fish. 
1,<b>Dragon Milk</b> : Exotic creatures, exotic properties, exotic tastes. Requires a *living* monster as source. Milking a dragon would truly be a challenge. 
1,<b>Troll Karies</b> : Requires a *living* monster as source. Killing a troll is hard, inspecting its teeth while it is alive harder.. and feeding a troll sweets for a year and making sure it does not brush its teeth hilarious. 
1,<b>Fresh Basilisk Droppings</b>: Requires a *living* monster as source. As for basilisk droppings, everybody knows they turn to stone if exposed to sunlight for more than a few minutes, and who knows why someone would want any, but this is what the client ordered...so how does an adventurer go about getting some? 
1,<b>Balaberry Plants</b> : grow only in wild thickets, and they are usually guarded fiercely by pixies and their ilk, who love to eat the fermented berries. Elves, however, may sometimes bargain for enough Balaberries to make a thick, syrupy wine that they call Ashala. A "recent" bottle of Ashala (anything up to 100 years old) can fetch 50 gp easily, but a truly excellent vintage that has been properly aged (say 500 years or more) might be worth as much as 1000 gp, especially to an elven wine collector. 
1,<b>Seed of Marawa</b> : A plant growing deep under ground only. It is rare,sometimes used in business (communities of the deep may value it for about 100-200 gold) and can be processed into the finest alcohol of the Deep. Bigger than a coconut, black, very hard shell.
