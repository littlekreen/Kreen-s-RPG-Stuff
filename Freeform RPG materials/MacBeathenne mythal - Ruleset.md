Metasentient Mythal
===================

Mythals of this type are heavily modified from their original elven roots. More resembling human spellwork this mythal is of a similar titanic level but anchored to a single metasentient construct that maintains and is the center of the effect. The construct doesn\'t have much of an intelligence of its own instead it employs a simple construct intelligence as a base to maintain operating precepts determined upon its construction. As such, its "sentience" is formed of the intelligence of its token bearers rather than copying the intellect, stealing, or creating one anew. Though this means the metasentient borrows the use of their mind the token bearers do not directly control the metasentient\'s use of their faculties. The metasentient otherwise makes no attempt to prevent the bearer from being aware of what knowledge it is currently employing. The desired end of any borrowed knowledge used may be missing however.

Token Bearers
-------------

Token bearers greatly affect the metasentient as it is formed from them. Those accepted as token bearers are only acknowledged when they are conscious. If a token bearer is rendered unconscious the metasentient cannot use them for various abilities and they do not count toward the seers\' abilities. Token bearers also lose contact with the metasentient if they leave the range of the mythal and reestablish contact once they reenter. The tokens retain an arcane mark as per the spell that remains in effect until the bonded object is destroyed or the token-bearer dies which enables this reestablished connection to occur. The arcane mark can be removed with erase or like spells but will be rewritten once the token-bearer returns to the mythal then leaves again. The mark itself is a derivative of the identity of the whole of the token-bearers so its design changes over time but this change occurs only while the token-bearer is within the mythal and is always a current representation of the emotional state of the whole of the token bearers. Those familiar with the arcane marks over a minimum period of two weeks and are able to see them can determine the amount of time that has passed since the token-bearer left the mythal with a knowledge (arcana) check DC 17. The person may then make a sense motive check DC 20 to discern how the token bearers are feeling on the whole.

Actions
-------

 The metasentient has its own actions as well as the seers. The metasentient gains a standard action and a five foot step usable per round per seer. Also the metasentient has its own standard action and five foot step though it cannot move. Skill attempts can be made as an action of the metasentient or from the individual seers though the seers do not receive bonuses to the skill unless used by a token-bearer.

Skills
------

As the metasentient is a function of the token-bearers they inherit skills from them. The metasentient gains the highest rank skill from its token bearers and an automatic synergy bonus equal to double the number of token bearers with more than 5 ranks in a given skill. If knowledge being borrowed is taken primarily from one person the remaining persons with lesser knowledge merely assist the core sentient. This primary skill provider could delve the desired end of their skill with a DC 15 concentration check though those merely assisting cannot do so. Success imparts the intended consequence to the user but not its used location. This skill use on the part of the metasentient does not consume actions from those used as donors though it causes a -2 to concentration, spellcraft, and the involved skill checks while this ability is in use. The metasentient can choose to mentally assist a specific token bearer as a standard action which imparts the synergy bonus it would normally have for using the skill to the subject of the metasentient\'s assist action instead. Token-bearers already using a desired skill cannot be used by the core and do not count for any synergy bonuses though the target becomes aware of the core\'s interest.

Feats
-----

The metasentient inherits feats from the token bearers as a matter of reflex. The metasentient gains access to all feats that do not conflict and are not dependent on race. Those feats that conflict can be chosen between by the metasentient as a free action. There is a 10% chance that the metasentient will employ a feat on a token-bearer\'s behalf when beneficial to do so while on the token-bearer\'s turn. The metasentient can otherwise employ a feat to a token-bearer with an opposed concentration check. If the metasentient wins the token-bearer is unaware of the action.

Spells
------

Certain spell-based effects, mostly to token-bearers, are caused within a mythal controlled by a metasentient. The seers of the metasentient can cast spells out of a token-bearer\'s memorized spells should the metasentient feel the need to. The token-bearer is aware of the intended use, target of the spell, and can choose whether or not to allow the action. If permitted to cast the metasentient takes the memorized spell from the token-bearer\'s memory and performs the spell to the caster\'s ability. Once the spell is cast the metasentient chooses all parameters of the spell whereupon it is cast from one of the seers or directly from the body of a token-bearer. Spells requiring verbal or somatic components are not required for a spell cast in this way though a silencing effect or a physical hold on the source will still prevent spells with the relevant components unless the metasentient has access to the silent and still spell metamagic feats from a token-bearer.

Special Mitigating Factors
--------------------------

As this mythal includes beings as one of its primary functional components they can ease creation of this mythal in specific manners. For every prospective token bearer present during the mythal creation the lead caster gains a spellcraft DC -1 plus an additional -1 per two caster levels of each token-bearer. The maximum individuals with unused caster levels allowed for mitigation equals the class levels of lead caster. In order to count for this bonus all token bearers must meet the requirements and have lived inside the intended mythal range without leaving for a minimum of four months. If more individuals than the lead caster can employ are available the individual token-bearers will be used in order of highest number of caster levels.

This type of mythal integrates best with well-forested areas over long ranges and requires less effort to create the mythal for the intended range. Gains a -1 DC mitigating factor per area increase of the mythal if a majority of the area increase is forested (temperate -- forested or tropical - forested)

Special Qualities
-----------------

### Side Effects (SU)

Any prevalent power or spell has a side effect that in comparison to the prevalent power or spell used is balanced against the benefit provided. The side effect might not be related to the same subject matter or under different and specific conditions though ultimately the DM decides the side effects for the mythal rather than the creator. The creator of the mythal is allowed a spellcraft check DC 30 to know a very general nature of the side effects. The spellcaster cannot affect the side effects during creation as they only come into existence after creation. Side effects double a power or spell\'s cost.

The level of side effects is equal to the effective level of a prevalent power plus half the total number of components per side effect. Ex: Four components producing effects equal to 7th , 8th , 3rd, and 5th, level spells could have side effects of 9th, (2 \* 5th), 5th, and (2 x 3rd) respectively. Side effects rising above 9th level can become multiple spells of equal level rounded down though the level of those spells must be at least 1. As an example a 9th level spell with a equivalent 12th level side effect can become either two 6th, three 3rd, or four 1st level spells. Side effects involving multiple spells can have a condition for activation based on the results of any appropriately leveled spell or added special effects that do not change the primary effects of the spell instead of one of the side effect spells.

### Versatile (SU)

The metasentient mythal can employ druid and divine spells as well as arcane spells as long as all designers of the mythal have class levels or arcane knowledge skills in the relevant types equal to 10 + 3 DC per spell level. 0th level spells can always be employed regardless of class.

Inherent Powers:
----------------

### Right of denial (SU)

A metasentient mythal is attached directly to the area\'s ley nodes and thus can deny any spellcaster access to magic within the mythal\'s range. One such person can be designated as a free standard action plus one class level per 10 class levels of all token bearers within the zone. Above the first designate the metasentient must have a number of caster levels among token bearers to equal that of the caster levels of the person(s) being denied. If not enough valid token bearers remain for the number of designated denials then the metasentient may choose which to rescind. Once the target leaves the mythal\'s range they can once again cast magic and must be redesignated in order to deny them upon reentry. This denial however cannot affect spells once they are already cast.

### \[Side Effect\] For good or ill (SU)

The metasentient mythal cannot deny magic to token-bearers until their tokens are observed and removed from the core. The metasentient is also unable to inhibit druid magic in any form.

MacBeathenne Mythal
===================

Societal Context (Non-canon)
----------------------------

### Newspaper article \#1

A structure sprung up in the forest near our town but few months hence was apparently the brainchild of Kreen, recently adopted by clan MacBeathenne. As chief architect of this \'mythal\', rumored built so unspecified damage incurred during the healing of the western lands could be repaired, the full identity of the individual is unclear though transcripts in the court mention Kreen as plaintiff in a recent case against a local church. Given Kreen\'s apparent talent with magic, apparently equaled by few, a greater portion of power in this mythal is in the form of \'Seers\' hand-crafted by Kreen with strange powers that add to the mythal\'s rather unique distinctiveness while nestled in the countryside. Seers go to and fro in the city at times as flying glass eyes of varied decoration and colors that exhibit an unnerving intelligence in their movements. They have yet to be other than benevolent toward the township so by and large they\'re fondly looked upon in areas traveled. The full range of their movements is reputed to be approximately 3 km in radius centered on the \'gate\' facility itself though this range does not cover the entire township. The residents within this area do report occasionally dreaming of the workers at the facility but the images do not interact with them and the workers continue to deny any such abnormal contact. Opinion of the facility seems to be of concern but the architect\'s continued support and reliance on training veterans or homeless for work in the facility have garnered the heretofore unknown architect a favorable light within the community. Appearance of a previously blind boy with seers for eyes, reporting to this facility weeks at a time, caused some worry in the community but the boy has proven to be perfectly healthy regardless of what happens at the facility and has resumed schooling at the facility. In similar vein, rumors of these veterans returning home to their families with skeletal limbs replacing ones previously lost continue to set alight community interest in the goings-on at the facility though the leadership of Clan MacBeathenne remains silent on the matter. The facility itself is similarly silent as signs are posted to ban all logging though in recent months the forest has become extremely groomed on an abnormally massive scale. Residents moving freely through the forest mention the immediate proximity of the gate is fenced off but tourism of the forest has increased in light of the multitude of groomed trees and flowers within the range. Town leadership at this point has voiced support for the facility, despite the relative silence of Clan MacBeathenne on its specific nature, which has allayed many fears of what exactly is being constructed at the facility. What few inquisitive fellows have trespassed the inner fence were evicted quietly without any apparent charges or incident then asked not to reenter. Further information will be released as it is discovered.

### Newspaper article \#2

Outside near a local hospital a favored cherry tree on its rear side has taken a stark white appearance. Nestled just inside the apparent range of the gate facility Clan MacBeathenne answered, when questioned about the possible link, "We do not feel it is appropriate to comment specifically at this time. Kreen has informed us to assure the community that this change is an unplanned benefit to those at the hospital though at this time we advise against eating the tree\'s fruit until it is properly lab-tested for purity." Seers were observed by patients working at the site before the tree appeared in the same week a facility worker stayed there. Since the worker left a number of fully grown evergreen trees have sprouted up in the albino\'s immediate vicinity. As the albinism has yet to spread to any other trees the singular cherry tree is merely considered an oddity for patients to appreciate from afar though members of the hospital staff say that a promising development is being made from the tree\'s fruit.

Precepts
--------

### Kreen\'s precepts

1.  Incite no lasting harm to the living willfully as long as they bring no lasting harm to others.
2.  Undo lasting harm as best able unless doing so violates precept the first.
3.  Secret no knowledge from token-bearers unless it violates precept the first.
4.  Foster the forest and prevent those from exploiting it without prior agreement of all token bearers.
5.  Let no unknown wander the forest alone.

### Description

Seers are the eyes, ears, and often hands of the mythal metasentient. They preform daily tasks related to the maintenance of the mythal and furthering of the power base inside the mythal. More often than not the Seers will retreat instead of confront anyone hostile toward them though the Protectors will confront dangerous intruders.

### Mythal-bound (SU)

The Seers cannot leave the mythal and lose all their capabilities if they do. Once they reenter the mythal they remain inert until the a core takes control of them.

### Telepathy (SP)

The Seers can communicate through telepathy though in general almost exclusively with each other. Seers are more inclined to communicate with token bearers but still tend to keep to themselves. They have simple minds and needs as a construct though generally interact with others only when the core or a token bearer needs them to. Token bearers usually end up talking with themselves as through the core the Seer will use the token bearer\'s own intelligence to respond to their queries.

### Difficult to Destroy (EX)

The seers are shrunken from a much larger construct 32 times their size and though they cease functioning when their HP reaches 0 any active ordermongers can repair other seers in any state as long as they are not disjoined. The individual seers cannot be broken without first disjoining as they are too dense. They gain a shield bonus at all times due to an active spell of the same name and have a damage reduction of 5/sound as they are glass and so vulnerable to vibration.

Seer Powers
-----------

Powers are listed in the following order: At will, 3/day, 1/day

### Protector

Protectors tend to any destructive influences in the mythal. Rather than face the threat alone they generally summon a token bearer with fighting skills and assist by causing pain in an unwanted hostile target. If merely shooing a threatening animal they will attack the animal with their cause pain skill should a whisperer be unable to get the animal to leave. Their flight speed is 50 with the same maneuverability and can hustle over long distances due to more robust levitation spells used in their construction. Protectors are designed to avoid blows and possess the dodge feat. Protectors are also instilled with a basic awareness of stealth and thus gain +5 in their hide checks while moving. Their movement is always silent when under half-speed.

#### Cause pain

Seers can induce pain in the target that debilitates an offending creature. Will save to resist is DC 10 + 1 per 2 rounds exposed. When subject to the ability the target gains -2 to damage and attack per round then also becomes dazed from pain on the second round. Should the target lose the save by 10 or more the effect ends and the target becomes unconscious. If the target saves by more than 10 the target cannot be affected again for another hour by the same protector. This ability cannot affect sleeping targets, undead, targets immune to mind-affecting spells, or any token-bearers.

#### Summon Token Bearer

The Seer can reposition a token bearer within the mythal when important tasks require immediate attention. This ability can move a token-bearer to a location within a 10\' radius of the protector\'s position. Any token bearer outside the mythal or currently unconscious cannot be targeted. Upon being targeted the token bearer will be aware of the environment at the destination and where exactly the metasentient is attempting to teleport the target to. The token bearer must then decide whether to follow the repositioning that round or be teleported.

#### Living to Tree

This ability is used to keep problematic individuals in check while the seers retrieve token bearers to deal with them. These seers as a whole can turn one living target into a tree of the same species nearest to the target per 15 token-bearers within the mythal. The target retains its vision at the same position and a functioning mental capacity. Avoiding this transformation is a DC 17 fortitude save.

The transformed target will remain a tree, immobile and silent, until either a token bearer touches the tree intent on abdicating the curse or a remove curse, limited wish, or wish spell cast on the target to reverse the effect. Token bearers will be able to immediately identify a tree created in this manner and a general idea of what the original form was. This cannot be used to inhibit poison or disease damage and should the transformed target die due to any already active effects would have on its original form or of damage to the tree itself the deceased target will revert back to its original form as a corpse. Items on the target\'s person are dropped around the foot of the tree.

### Preserver

Preservers continuously inspect living things within the mythal for injury. If finding any injured living creatures they call for other seers to assist in the injured party\'s health. They are neutral in these duties and do not discriminate between targets even if the token-bearers desire them to ignore a target. The perservers have an exception for those that have demonstrated hostility toward the seers or token-bearers and will soundly ignore such persons if not summon a protector. Basic biological knowledge is instilled into the preservers for the purposes of healing and they receive a +10 competence bonus to healing checks.

#### Seal Wounds

This ability stops all bleeding from surface wounds as the target takes 1 point of fire damage. The target stabilizes immediately but the ability does not significantly affect internal injuries and thus cannot heal. When the ability is used a token bearer that can cast arcane spells can choose to augment the spell with a level one or two spell slot for different and stronger effects. A level one slot applied by a token bearer will stop internal bleeding healing 2d6 subdual damage and cause 1d3 fire damage. A level two spell slot applied will also properly seal flesh together if an amputated limb is pressed to the stump and the subject will take 1d6 fire damage as well as 1 point of temporary constitution damage.

#### Necrotic Fire shield

This ability allows a subject to mitigate damage when exposed to fire. Subject gains resist fire 10 for 2d6 minutes. For every 5 fire damage the subject receives 2d4 + con bonus in HP and takes 1 point of temporary constitution damage for that round. If the constitution damage would reduce the target below 1 con the target gains DR 5/fire for that round instead.

#### Seed Bloodberry

This effect transmutes a living fruit or seed bearing plant into a Bloodberry plant. Other plants that do not produce detachable seed pods or fruit are not compatible and thus cannot be transmuted. Intelligent plants also cannot be targeted. The transformation takes d8 days per size category above tiny of the target plant. Plants transformed by the ability bear only a superficial resemblance to the original specie: The new plant becomes albino, if the base plant has a hibernation cycle the bloodberry will follow it, the target plant becomes perennial if it isn\'t already and gains a hibernation cycle through cold seasons, does not grow while producing berries until reaching the maximum number, and gains immunity to disease and other parasites. Should the Bloodberry be fertilized by the corpse of an intelligent creature or daily blood spilling during its transformation period the main stem will take on a deep red color with the plant producing twice as many berries as is normal for the plant from that point forward. Such red tainted Bloodberry plants are considered undead for the purposes of detecting undead and spells or abilities that damage or turn undead.

Bloodberries have soft inner flesh with viscous red fluid that has a sharp metallic/cinnamon taste which is their namesake. The consistency of the berry remains similar to the original seedpod or fruit. Bloodberry plants normally produce 5 berries per size category of the progenitor plant while doubling production for each size category the fruit is smaller than the parent plant while halving it for each step above. The fruit cannot be more than two category sizes different than the progenitor plant. Most berries take on a roughly spherical shape though they resemble the original seed pod. The berries themselves are sterile so cannot start a new plant and parts separated from the plant will not germinate on their own. Each berry heals d3 plus d3 per two size categories above fine but must be consumed entirely in order to gain benefit of the healing or prepared as the majority component in some other food. Partly eaten portions lose their effectiveness within two hours of being detached from the plant and rot quickly. The plant absorbs 1 HP per day from all other plants one size category smaller than itself or any larger than that within its wide root radius which is triple the normal radius for its base species as the roots are the only regularly growing part of the plant beside the berries themselves. The berries grow as HP is absorbed by the parent plant enough for the healing value of each berry and the plant begins to grow or heal again once the maximum amount of berries is reached. Should the Blood berry find no valid hosts it consumes HP from itself to produce berries until it dies as it does not otherwise heal itself. Bloodberry is a template which is overlaid on the original plant.

### Plant tender

Plant tenders see to the furthering of the forest and ensure maximum plant density. Should plants become ill-suited to their location the plant tenders will reposition the involved plant to a better location. They tend to follow those the metasentient is aware as having forest management skills even if they are not token bearers. Plant tenders also see that areas do not become overgrown and combine immature and overly dense species into larger specimens. Plant tenders have knowledge (nature) 10 as basic plant information and common knowledge is instilled in them during construction. Plant tenders also have knowledge (geography) 5 as they are also provided with basic land types to determine appropriate locations for plant life.

#### Store Seed

This ability is used to relocate seeds from near their parent plant to other locations within the mythal. The ability transports up to d% mature targeted seeds into an extradimensional space even from within the seed containers of living plants. The seeds can then be either released onto the ground or planted individually up to 2" into viable soil. Token bearers can mentally choose to plant seeds from this space if they are currently touching the seer with a knowledge (nature) of DC 5. The seeds can be removed as a free action as many times as is necessary to remove all seeds from the stored space.

#### Vilyan\'s Purity

This ability relocates any individual species contained entirely within the area to a viable location in the other area. Affects two areas within the mythal 10ft square + 5\' per token bearer with a knowledge (nature) skill above 5. These areas must not overlap. These areas need not be contiguous, they can be distributed in any fashion, but the seer must have been to both areas. If the destination is to an area that will not support the plant the ability will fail. The DC for success is a knowledge (nature) check DC 10 for common species, DC 15 for rare species, DC 20 for any other species not native to the area, and DC 25 for any plant not native to the plane. Should the check be failed d% of the plants are killed outright in transition. Intelligent plant creatures can choose not to be relocated but have a DC of 30 to move successfully.

#### Fruition

This effect can consume members of a certain species into one specimen of equal mass. The plant must be known in detail to the Seer (Knowledge nature check DCs as Vilyan\'s purity) to merge them into an appropriately sized specimen of their combined mass. Failure of the knowledge check results in no merge and half of d% are deformed in the attempt with most dying. This ability can affect only non intelligent plants. The total area affected is equal to a double the radius of mature specimens within that plant species but the spell will not affect any plant material outside the mythal. A token bearer with the relevant skill and holding the seer can use this ability and will be automatically assisted by the core as per its skill rules.

### Gatekeeper

Gatekeepers see to the induction of token-bearers and will induct anyone whom the majority of token-bearers feel is suitable. They are often keyed to specific token-bearers that have an authoritative say over whom can be inducted into the core. Gatekeepers have Sense Motive + 5 as a basic ability to process emotional and body language patterns is instilled into gatekeepers. This bonus only takes effect for races already acknowledged as token-bearers. Gatekeepers have Bluff + 5 as the same ability instilled into the gate keepers to sense motives also allows them to detect lies to a certain extent.

#### Alter token

The Seer can either accept a token into the core\'s awareness or remove one from it though the token must be visible for the effect to work. The bearer must be an intelligent creature living or otherwise to receive the token binding. In order to bind a token must be chosen that is genuinely precious to the target being bound though can be any object. The item must remain on the target\'s person to count for any tasks as a token bearer. Should the token be destroyed a new one can be created as the ordermonger can refurbish a new copy of the stored token. The token bearer is no longer acknowledged during the meantime for tasks requiring an existing acknowledged token. Tattoos or other bodily modifications are valid as tokens but can not be refurbished by ordermongers.

#### Locate token

The Seer can locate any token within the mythal. Token bearers can do this once per day if within a 10\' radius of the gatekeeper though the target must be a token of an active token-bearer.

#### Oath of Service

The Seer can accept an oath from a living intelligent being willing to perform a service for the metasentient while not giving them powers of a token bearer. When the offer is made the target will be aware of the task that is expected of them and may either make the oath of service or refuse. Should the target refuse the effect can still be used that day. However should any of the following be true the effect fades: the allotted time for the task has passed, target intentionally abandoned the oath, the target died, the target knowingly violated of the core\'s precepts, the oath was rescinded by the core, or the target knows the task has been completed. The metasentient will be aware, as will the oath taker though immediately, once the oath is either completed or broken after d4 days per 100 miles from the mythal as well as the circumstances of completion as long as they are on the same plane as the metasentient. If the target moves to a different plane the oath be dormant as neither party will be aware of any status changes until the oath-bearer returns to the mythal\'s home plane. While the oath taker is within the mythal they will gain the ability to contact any of the Seers to enlist their abilities but not control them directly. Should the time alloted to the oath expire before the mythal is aware of completion the effect will complete as if the task was abandoned. Any token bearer holding this seer can use this ability though if the target violates the core\'s precepts in the course of the service the token-bearer will have their token removed from the core.

### Darkeyed

Darkeyed serve as solitary stealth surveillance for the core at night or in underground locales. Have a 60 movement rate with the same maneuverability. They generally are continuously moving unless directly observing something and respond to hostility with their snuff light ability and continuing their observation. Should a subject continue to be hostile after using the snuff light ability they will shadow-step to safety and observe at distance. These seers have a +5 to spot as the darkeyed have superior lens and visual construction and are very sensitive to movement.

#### Dark Peer

The Seer peers into the shadow plane to see through normal as well as magical darkness. Well lighted areas become pitch black and pitch black is lighted with similarly inverted levels in between.

#### Snuff Light

The Seer can inhibit the emission of light in the vicinity. Light sources, reflected or otherwise, dim within 5d4 feet of the seer to a tenth of their original brightness for the next 1d3 hours. Effect is centered on the Seer. If a token bearer uses this ability it doubles in effectiveness.

#### Shadow Step

The Seer can phase through the shadow plane The destination can be any shadow any other Seer is currently observing within the mythal area. Token bearers holding the seer can use this skill but are limited to areas of full natural darkness.

### Brighteyed

Brighteyed seers see their primary use during the night in conjunction with token bearers. They illuminate dark places for token bearers as their primary duty but are used in volume during the day. Have a 60 movement rate with the same maneuverability. They generally are continuously moving unless directly observing something and respond to hostility by using their light-step to go to safety and observe at distance. These seers have a +5 to spot as the Brighteyed have superior lens and visual construction and are very sensitive to movement.

#### Chain Spotlight

The Seer can use its sight to induce light with which to brighten its environment. An invisible 20 foot cone causes objects in the cone to glow as per the light spell.

#### Banish Shadow

The Seer can remove all shadow from an area of its choosing. This ability affects a 10\' sphere + 1 foot per token bearer within the mythal though the range is personal centered on the seer. The area looks as if lit at noon but lacks any shadows.

#### Light Step

Similar to the Darkeyed\'s shadow step the Seer can teleport to any light source it can see or is aware of its position. Token bearers can use this skill to walk out from any point of bright light within the mythal though the destination must be large enough to hold them.

### Ordermonger

Ordermonger are Seers dedicated to the repair of objects influenced by disorder through damage. They will use their minor repair skill on anything they perceive as damaged or even worn by use. Items such as clothing or stonework are common targets but they cannot repair living material. They also see to the repair of major damage to mundane components to the metasentient\'s mythal structure or outright fabrication of fresh parts to replace those parts that have been completely destroyed as long as remains of the part are still present.

#### Repair, Minor

The Seer can seal small surface cracks and weaknesses in solid, unliving, raw substances (such as dead wood, stone, or metal but not a painting) or rejoin a mythal part broken off. Pieces broken off should be pressed to the appropriate joint as long as the parts are not otherwise altered by damage as this spell does not repair burnt or consumed material back into its original substance. This effect does not affect living material but nonliving material foreign to the living matter can be repaired even if internal to a living object. This effect cannot be used to add modifications to matter that did not already exist and such attempts knowingly or otherwise automatically fail. It can affect a square inch of damaged area plus a square inch for every token bearer within the mythal familiar with constructing those types of items. If repairing parts of the mythal itself the repairable area receives a bonus of half a square foot. The range of this ability is 5 feet and the seer or a token-bearer within range must be directly aware of the area to be repaired. Token bearers can use a seer to repair an item that they have ranks in the craft skill to repair. This use removes the need for fresh materials required by their craft skill even if they fail to craft or repair damage that this ability is valid to those skills.

#### Repair, Major

The Seer can reconstruct a missing part from nearby raw materials with this ability though it must have observed the original form to repair non-mythal items. The materials used must be the same as are used in the damaged part and are consumed to make the repairs. The repair area is the same however it may be shaped in any manner as long as the total volume is not exceeded. The ability can reconstruct up to four pounds of raw material per token bearer within the mythal into a damaged object but cannot create a whole new object from only raw material. The Seer must have been seen the original form at some point for this effect to work on non-mythal items or have a detailed diagram of its proper and complete nature with a token-bearer that can understand it. Despite having a digram for a given design this spell cannot be used to add modifications to matter that did not already exist before the damage and such attempts automatically fail. This effect does not affect living material but nonliving material foreign to the living matter can be repaired even if internal to a living object but the entire embedded repair area must be within 5 ft of the surface. The range of this ability is 30 feet though requires line of sight and includes any penetration distance. Token bearers can use a seer to repair an item that they have ranks in the craft skill to repair. This use removes the need for fresh materials required by their craft skill even if they fail to craft or repair damage that this ability is valid to those skills

#### Refurbish

The Seer can reconstruct an object into its original condition upon manufacture using nearby materials. The Seer must have physically seen the original object in its normal state for this effect to work or the target must be an original part to the mythal structure. Reconstruction of the object will take one turn per pound of all materials involved. There must be some raw material nearby or the remains of the destroyed part which is used in quantity identical to the original part to complete its reconstruction. Missing or corrupted material for use in the spell affects the integrity of the reconstructed part. Missing material will result in a failure within 3d6 days. Corrupted material results in failure within 1d4+1 months. Pure material is used in preference to corrupted material so if enough pure raw materials are present the object will not fail even if all the broken part is corrupted in some fashion. Token bearers can use this skill to fabricate a replacement object from a broken one but they must have sufficient ranks in the craft skill to produce the object in its entirety and read detailed schematics about the object\'s structure during fabrication increasing the DC by 10.

### Digger

Diggers reshape the earth throughout the mythal in various ways or to produce underground residences for Token bearers. Various thick uniform stone tunnels and underground structures are produced suitable to the token-bearers. These tunnels can be quite expansive and are often very deep. If the diggers have no other duties they sometimes filter through their piles of vented earth for crystals or ores that are not subject to their change hardness skill. These materials are usually vented into piles near the center of the mythal. Diggers have a basic knowledge of load and structure inscribed during their construction which gives them a +5 bonus to Knowledge (Architecture), Knowledge (Masonry), and craft (stonework)

#### Carve Earth

This spell allows the digger to move clay or dirt from one place to another even from walls underground. Dirt or clay can be sliced off and absorbed up to 1 cubic foot per round while stone or shale from an object can be carved and absorbed at a rate of 1 cubic foot per turn. Sand can instead be vacuumed into an extradimensional holding area at a rate of 2 cubic feet per round. The Diggers individually can contain inside the extradimensional space 4 cubic feet + 1 cubic foot per two token-bearers within the mythal. The shape of absorbed material can be determined by the digger in order to produce flat spaces. The material must be released somewhere into its environment however before the ability can be used again once engaged. The maximum diameter object to intake is equal to the cubed root of the total volume available per digger however the material must be loose matter and solid masses greater than 3 cubic feet cannot be absorbed. Reinforced constructed walls, gemstones, heavy metals such as lead or gold, or very hard stone like marble or granite cannot be carved by this ability unless the change hardness ability is used.

#### Change Hardness

This ability is used so that the digger can either reinforce or weaken material while making its way through. Seer can change the hardness of 10 cubic feet + 2 feet per token-bearers viewing the digger. The ability can change all nonliving material in the defined area one step either harder or softer: Stone becomes shale, shale becomes clay, clay becomes dirt, and dirt becomes sand. This ability does cannot affect gemstones or metals. The seer can shape this area as it desires but it must be contiguous and start within a foot. This ability can produce heavy damage to stone or mud constructs natural or otherwise and they take 3d6 damage from the transmutation which bypasses natural hardness and DR.

#### Vent Earth

The Seer can remove up to four tons of loose surface material like a pile of loose earth, gravel, or mined stone to any other location within the mythal. The pile is vacuumed into a gray extradimensional sphere over the space of an hour which then flies at a speed of 100 feet to the destination before emptying its contents over the course of a turn. The traveling containment sphere has 1 HP and a Hardness of 10 so any damage to the gray sphere will destroy the container and immediately empty its contents to the ground.

### Waterflit

Waterflits keep the water supply to the forest that supports them pure and untainted. As per their duty they spend a great deal of time filtering large bodies of water to gather pollutants which are then poured into large stone cisterns prepared by diggers either underground or carved out of large boulders. In the absence of bodies of water to productively filter they create clouds if the water supplies are low or transmute unused surface liquids into water that would otherwise be unusable for other purposes. Waterflits can move through water at half speed giving them an effective swim speed of 20.

#### Purify water

This ability is used to ensure the water supply within the mythal remains pure of any potentially plant-killing materials. The Seer can remove impurities from up to a gallon of water per round as dissolved nonliving material is removed from the water and expelled into a container within the mythal of the metasentient\'s choosing. This affect has no effect on living matter, cannot do damage, and the liquid to be purified must be a fluid consisting of mostly water.

#### Dehydrate

The seer can transmute any liquid compound into water. D% of the volume of fluid is converted into water up to 20 gallons as the remaining portion, consisting often mostly of unusable material or untransmuted water, is reduced to its component parts with a crack of thunder into a vaporous cloud that dissipates into the environment.

Those breathing in this cloud must make a DC 12 fortitude check or be nauseated for D6 rounds. The water will emerge at a point within the mythal chosen by the metasentient or at a point within 30\' of a handling token-bearer.

#### Summon Clouds

With this ability the core seer can produce new water should the area be lacking though to activate it all waterflits in the area must be present as well as at least 10 token bearers. As this ability requires heavy activity of the gate it cannot be in use while this ability is active. As this strain\'s the gate the ability cannot be employed more than once every 30 days. With assistance of the core gate the Seer can open a temporary portal at the top range of the mythal that reaches into the elemental plane of water as to fill the sky with thunderclouds. Living things, elementals, or solid objects are prevented from passing through the portal by the gate itself. The clouds emerging from the portal all spread at a rapid pace and have a 75% chance to immediately begin heavy precipitation or double their range every hour for d6 hours then begin raining. 1d4 inches worth of water is within the thunderclouds that may precipitate over the entire surface area below the clouds over the course of 1d4+1 hours.

### Whisperer

Whisperers are used primarily to manage the animals in the forest and provide backup in lieu of conscious token-bearers. They tend to follow rangers or other forest-aware token-bearers as some of their abilities depend on them for utility and oOccasionally they empower animals to sentience to drive them to complete tasks required by the metasentient. Whisperers are instilled with basic knowledge of animals that may live within the mythal and have knowledge (nature) + 10. Equipped with a more focused intellect these seers also have a concentration bonus of +5.

#### Read animal memories

The seer can interpret the memories of any mundane animal within the mythal but can only affect animals tiny size or larger. The last d6 hours of memories are imparted to the metasentient and given to one of the token-bearers for storage but a token bearer can gain no more than his intelligence bonus in hours which take a round each to transfer. If the receiving token bearer cannot retain the entire memory they instead retain as much to the present as possible and the rest is discarded.

#### Breadcrumbs

This power detects any damage to plants or earth nearby and imparts the knowledge as a nighttime glow of the detected damaged areas to a designated token-bearer. The newfound knowledge adds a competence bonus of +10 to tracking attempts made by the token-bearer. This effect gathers information from the Seer\'s location within a 20\' radius + 5\' per class level of the chosen token-bearer.

#### Loan Competence

This ability partly links the metasentient with an animal of any tiny or larger size as to give it a human intelligence. Though this ability changes the target animal\'s intelligence score to 10 for the duration of the concentration by the seer the animal\'s alignment still remains the same. This effect requires continuous mild concentration by the seer (DC 10) to maintain and the seer cannot take any other actions except to move. The animal can make a will save DC 17 to resist initially and thereafter the whisperer can maintain this effect for as long as is necessary to achieve its ends. Once per round the Seer can telepathically communicate with the animal without breaking concentration and usually does so though it gains no direct control of the animal through this ability. The animal gains one language which is understood by the majority of token-bearers for the purpose of communication of thought though its form may not have the capacity to produce speech. When the effect ends the animal retains memories gained but in returning to its normal intellect may lose the ability to fully understand them.

### Firebug

Firebugs are used to inhibit the advancement or development of a forest fire within the mythal\'s borders as their first reaction to uncontrolled fire is to attempt to extinguish it. Should the fire prove stronger than the resources it has available the firebug will begin creating a wall of scorched earth to inhibit the fire\'s advancement. Lastly it will vacate a body of water in the mythal into the atmosphere above to try and put out the fire. Firebugs are constructed with heat resistant materials above that of normal seers, they have resist fire 10 in addition to their existing damage reduction.

#### Extinguish Flame

This ability reduces the size and intensity of a fire as it reduces a natural flame by one half for every 5 rounds concentrated on the area. Fires passing below tiny size go out instead. The maximum area that this can effect is 2 square feet per token-bearer within the mythal distributed evenly among all firebugs using this skill.

#### Scorch earth

This ability consumes all flammable nonintelligent material within a certain area to stop the spread of a fire. The minimum area covered is a 10\' long, 10\' thick, 15\' high perpendicular line. The line also consumes material within 5\' underground. The ability gains additional maximum length of 10 feet per two class levels of token bearers within the mythal and must be contiguous. The consumed material inside this area erupts in a column of flame as the fuel is fully used within a round per size category above tiny. Any intelligent creature within the immolated space takes 2d6 points of damage while material is consumed. Possessions in direct contact with the intelligent creature are not subject to the ability\'s target area but may receive the fire damage taken to the character. This effect in producing a violent explosion deafens any creature within the line or inside a 25\' range for 2d6 hours.

#### Rainshot

This ability vaporizes a body of water into the atmosphere. It immediately results in a torrent of rain in equal volume to the body of water over the target area as a portal vacates the water into the atmosphere through thousands of small portals. This ability does not inherently cause damage to anything in the water though the fall from several hundred feet may prove deadly. This effect requires the gate to be inactive and ready for portal creation and if a token bearer uses the ability they may control the total area covered by the torrent of rain. Otherwise uncontrolled the water itself will arrive as fist sized globs of water over the entire mythal area.

Prevalent Powers
----------------

### Prevalent Power, Major (50,000 x 2 side effect x .5 limited area = 50,000)

#### Abnormally grounded etherics

This power is put in place by the machine in order to limit the effectiveness of high fey magic as any spell above the 9th level, epic magic, or any other such high powered ritual magic cast on a target within range of the mythal is grounded into the earth as the enrichment version of the plant growth spell. The plant growth effect is cast at the level of the absorbed spell in the same area or d% x 10 feet in the case of leveless effects, whichever is larger. Any ritual lead spellcaster must make another spellcraft check for the ritual at +20 DC or take d6 backlash damage per two caster levels. The spell may also be willfully abandoned for no penalty. Should the caster make the spellcraft check the metasentient can make a save against the spell on behalf of those within its area using the statistics of any token bearer most beneficial to the task. Should the caster fail the spellcraft check they can save versus will for half damage. Any other participants in the ritual also take 2d6 damage each should the lead caster take backlash damage with no save. This effect covers a quarter of the mythal (2500 ft range) and is keyed that it does not apply to sentient constructs or token-bearers.

#### \[Side effect\] Core\'s equity

Etheric grounding to the land was added to vent fae hellstrikes or other unwanted spells but this has created a bit of chaos due to the other necromatic conjuration spell added by the machine. This side effect produces a number of effects as well as increasing the severity of other side effects within the mythal. The part of Vilyan\'s spirit converted for magic use, adaption to the plane\'s native magic, and the spirit transmutation effects of powers added by the machine produce alter those lives newly conceived within its confines. Any successful conception by compatible intelligent creatures within the mythal has a chance to be transmuted into freetether sylvan dryads if female or be any other living sentient species native to the plane that are not of the parent\'s species. This chance for an altered pregnancy is 40 percent within the immediate confines of the gate facility (400 ft) which then drops by half per every tenth of the remaining distance to the boundaries of the mythal where it is zero.

Sentient creatures inside the mythal are always considered fertile for this chance even if either the parents would normally be sterile as this is part transmutation and part conjuration though if the child is successfully conceived from a normally sterile parent they will return to sterility after the birth of the child. Should a remove curse, dispel magic, or remove disease be attempted during pregnancy with an altered child the effect sustaining the transmutation will cease and the malformed unborn child will die. Once the child has been born the effect is complete and is no longer present however this effect is a standing enchantment and will persist outside the mythal until it runs its course. Children born in this way have a lifespan equal to their parent\'s species and mature accordingly.

Freetether dryads are as the dryad entry except as follows. As a plant, freetether dryads are completely absent of body heat even in vitro but must be put in contact with a tree within 72 hours of being born so they can instinctively bond to it or begin to suffer as if too distant. The freetether dryad will always be aware of the status of this initial tree as well as to any others they\'ve bonded themselves to since mature freetether dryads can switch their bond to any tree of that same species once every five years. While switching they still must spend no longer than 72 hours outside their maximum radius to reach the desired tree or begin to sicken and their maximum distance from their tree is a mile per character level. Any freetether dryad spending more than 72 hours out of range of their tree or has it cut down will sicken and then die within 2d4x10 hours as if an important organ was removed. If dying in this way the freetether dryad cannot be resurrected unless their last bonded tree is reconstructed with a wish or act of deity. Also, if their tree is cut down the freetether dryad cannot transfer the loose bond to a new tree.

These freetether dryads can breed with males of any species valid for their progenitors as well as other dryads. Halfblood freetether dryad births exhibit fey traits though are sterile unless affected by the mythal. In genetic terms, the mythal induces another separate pair of chromosomes for non-freetether dryads: one for other species, and one for dryads. The dryad chromosome is dominant but cannot integrate with a dominant Y, thus male dryad births are inviable. If the recessive other species chromosome is present it consumes then replaces the progenitor\'s chromosomes resulting in a full blood of the relevant specie. The chromosomes from the progenitor species strongly influences the child\'s appearance and to some extent traits as the chromosomes from their progenitor species partly determines form. Any diseases inherited from the parents will not manifest as most of the functional characteristics are taken from the new chromosomes Children of a halfblood will breed as appropriate for their species. Children of a freetether dryad with any other species has the possibility to be half inviable, half either halfblood or fullblood dryad. Children of a halfblood and fey has the possibility to be half human of either gender, a quarter halfblood, and a quarter inviable Children of a freetether dryad and fey has the possibility to be half inviable and half halfblood dryad. Fullblood dryads will always produce their own race when not subject to the mythal as two other races. Any other race if having a child affected by the mythal has the possibility to be quarter of a different species than their own of either gender, a quarter halfblood dryad, an eighth fullblood, and the remainder will be inviable.

### Prevalent Power, Medium (20,000 x 2 side effect = 40,000)

#### Seer home

The core uses this spell to control and integrate any number of Seers from its own power source that communicate directly to the core. Any seer brought within the range of the mythal may enter the service of the metasentient at its option though those with self-derived mythallar powered through their user or designed to be powered by a different local source are supplanted as if the power source appropriate for the item but do not otherwise enter under the auspices of the core. All token-bearers can retrieve the viewpoint of a seer from the metasentient should they concentrate with a DC 15 though token-bearers cannot directly exert any control.

#### \[Side effect\] Scatter mind

Spellcasters in the mythal are sometimes subject to an effect that disperses their memorized spells from them. There is a 5% chance per day (only once per month) to involuntarily transfer memorized spells from a caster within the mythal randomly to those within a half mile of them. This transfer has a 75% chance to choose randomly among other spellcasters as the point of least resistance otherwise it will distribute randomly among those remaining. Divine and nature classes are not affected by this effect or those that are asleep. Those receiving the spells need the proper training to cast these memorized spells which otherwise dissipate in 24 hours. In any case if the spellcaster is aware of this check ahead of time or has previously experienced it they may make a DC 10 will save to resist the transfer check when it occurs.

### Prevalent Spell (base 1 x 1 x 100 x 2 minutes x 2 side effect = 800)

#### Night watch

From sundown to daybreak all intelligent beings within the area of the mythal are subject to faerie fire depending on their race though the aura is little more than a candle\'s brightness. It reacts in the following colors for the specified races: blue, for human; green, for fey; violet, for any other living being or those of mixed blood; and red, for outsiders, undead, elementals, or constructs. Token bearers can dispel the faerie fire at will and it will not return until the token-bearer chooses for it to do so. The effect will retarget the token-bearer once they sleep but can be dismissed again.

#### \[Side effect\] Gloom

Moonlight does not reach past areas under tree canopy unless at least a half-moon so the forest is pitch black unless other light sources are used. When moonlight is bright enough to reach to the forest floor a thick gray fog the smell of old forest emanates from the detritus on the forest floor as per the obscuring mist spell. Worked stone floors, paved areas, or buildings are neither subject to obscuring mist, gloom, nor faerie fire.

### Vanguard Spell (3 CL x 2 SL x 100 x .5 limited area x .5 spell completion = 150)

#### Restful Resurgence

Kreen does not need to sleep and finds it easier to work with those that sleep little. It has put in place a spell to amplify the natural healing capacities of creatures instead of healing them directly. The duration of the effect is one continuous rest period of four hours. It must be completed by a second level divine or nature caster. Paladins or other such warrior-servants of deities can also trigger this effect on first level. The target must be touched and be a willing intelligent creature though any intelligent creature within the mythal that can complete a spell-trigger of the appropriate level can cast this spell at will though not on themselves. Target must be willing to receive the spell or it will not function as the spell is otherwise considered harmless. This spell is limited to an area within half a mile of the gate.

Once subject to the effect The next time the target rests the effect is as if they had an entire day\'s bed rest. The effect terminates after a four hour duration which wakes the sleeper. The target will remember all dreams that occur during this rest in full detail. This spell cannot be used to gain more spells per day than the caster or target would ordinarily have and this rest does not result in negative effects due to long-term bed rest as long as the target is not physically idle long enough to acquire negative effects due to long-term bed rest. The spell can be reapplied after the four hour duration as many times as needed.
