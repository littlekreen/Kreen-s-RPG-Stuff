Faerun is wide with living creatures,
oft\' more than known by teachers.
Rumbling through deep forest night,
many give cause to run in flight.
Though danger there subsides by day,
take heed or the unwary would pay.
Mundane things rule near places human,
dislike have they for danger loomin\'.
Dogs, deer, bear, boar, lizards, and like,
such finds themselves at tip of spike.
Still danger there yet lurks at night,
ankhegs, wolves, and undead to fight.
Further still to cultured fens of elves,
fond of nature they keep to themselves.
Lived along as tenders in forests old,
balance of things calls forth hears of cold.
Flora and fauna all found plenty and fine,
in this some fell things cross this line.
Elementals earthen are known to play,
protecting animals mundane during day.
Rocs, renders, basilisk, and fiends found,
prohibited are these from damage profound.
Care brought by humans skilled in nature,
druids tend with wisdom to forests mature.
Around them cluster many weaker sort,
Dire ones bred to give species support.
Deeper down stocky dwarves till the ground,
nature joins them where new places they found.
Creatures here forsaken from light of day,
Worms, waters, fish,and fungus find their way.
Drow lurk here in cities of dark synonymous:
carnivores fungal and many spiders venomous.
Cultured things of magic roam widely in many lands,
Sentients disagree with fervor at nature\'s fickle favor.
Carrion crawlers found in dead themselves a place,
though from others\' lands they ripped away a space.
Gricks of beak, scale, and sucker went along their way,
though prefer them stony places where living once lay.
Of these aberrant creatures minds of mage have made,
perhaps sailing serpents deserve the skies they wade.
Despite what mages may decry to reasons contrary,
Kreen thinks breeding better left to farm and aviary.
Most certainly nature sometimes acts so very blindly,
but rarely does it take these wanton meddles kindly.
Perhaps to wonder about things in water,
Never floating leaves its knowledge to falter.
Krackens and turtles as islands it has heard,
these two things it finds much less absurd.
Sailors tend toward shining silver tongues,
truth is delved from their minds with funds.
Sea elves, merfolk would best see below.
Kreen reads of them and much they know.
As best it makes of such inquiry in generality,
wonder still to sate a inquisitive mentality?
Kreen tries as best to bring forth knowledge,
though limitations in this it does acknowledge.
