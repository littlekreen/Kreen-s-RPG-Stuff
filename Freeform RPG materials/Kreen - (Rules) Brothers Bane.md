Description
-----------

Two of these golems are known to exist. They were created by the lich Darkavien for the purpose of defending conjugate gates during construction. Their bodies are that of ornately constructed adamantite golems and in form resemble a well muscled gladiator whom is plate armored except for the biceps. The biceps are composed of a number of tightly woven cords and are just as resilient to damage as the rest of its material. Their eyes lie behind full helmets and glow purple against a mottled silver form. The same light emits from within the woven muscle of their bicep as well as from joints in their armor though the golem can extinguish this light at its option.

### Behavior

These golems are created by consuming a Solar as an imprint to the golem\'s mind. Though they are now shadows of the former being they retain a great deal of the celestial\'s former knowledge and all of its drive to its purpose. They suffer the indignity of doing the Lich\'s will but Kreen, Darkavien\'s emissary construct, treats them with humility and respect and it is returned in kind for their mutual situation. The two known golems in question were representatives of justice, namely to serve and protect, and though the solars from which they arose are gone the Gods do tend to the constructs as not to abandon a stolen servant. This tending is often when out of sight of Darkavien however and thus infrequent. The constructs will march headlong to combat if need be but their calculating minds leave nothing to mindless violence.

### Combat

Strategic and talented warriors as the solar they were in life these word golems will use their silence ability to quiet mages while they advance to obliterate their defenses and in short order the mage themselves. Devoted to each other they fight as siblings and will not separate while on duty unless necessary. They primarily rely on their greatswords but also employ their other spell like abilities. Their fast heal ability owes to their slow absorption of the weave around them and enables them to reattach dismembered limbs if tethered to the stump for at least 24 hours. The dismembered limb itself is not usable again until this period has passed. The necessary replacement metal flows outward from the wounds or stump as molten thereafter solidifying to its proper shape.

All golems of this type carry a +2 Disjoiner. It casts mordenkin\'s disjunction on hit at a range of up to 75 ft. The golem can freely control the range of this disjunction that has a will save DC of 23. The swords themselves cannot destroy artifacts though they may eliminate their effects. The swords have a cost of 368350
