Trumpet archon RP encounter
===========================

Scene
-----

Alley between two buildings. A red hopper hive has blocked the way entirely and the archon sits on the ground. Found initially looking down with its head in its hands. Name is long since forgotten and does not respond to anything unless approached.

When Approached
---------------

**The trumpet archon regards target:** I believe I can see the future

**Leans back maintaining eye contact:** \'Cause I repeat the same routine

**Puts hand over heart:** I think I used to have a purpose

**Looks down for a moment and shakes head:** Then again, that might have been a dream

**Looks down and clenches the mouthpiece stub of his trumpet in his hands:** I think I used to have a voice

**Turns it about in his hands:** And now I never make a sound

**Looks emphatically at target:** I just do what I\'ve been told

**Looks around fearfully:** I really don\'t want them to come around, oh no

**Looks directly at closest without apparent emotion:** Every day is exactly the same

**Looks back down at target\'s feet:** Every day is exactly the same

**Leans in to look at target better in the eyes:** There is no love here, and there is no pain

**Looks side to side:** I can feel their eyes are watching; in case I find myself again

**Leans back as if exhausted:** Sometimes I think I\'m happy here

**Shoulders shrug in a forced chuckle:** Sometimes, yeah, I still pretend

**Yells:** I can\'t remember how this got started

**Points at target:** Oh, but I can tell you exactly how it will end

**Head in hands:** Every day is exactly the same. Every day is exactly the same.

**Looks up from head in hands:** There is no love here, and there is no pain.

**INTERRUPT:** \*beckons\*

**Puts finger to underside of target\'s chin:** I\'m writing on a little piece of paper

**Leans past to whisper in target\'s ear:** I\'m hoping someday you might find

**Tilts head slightly and leans back:** Well, I\'ll hide it behind something

**Leans in again: **They won\'t look behind

**Eyes open wide showing gear surrounded pupil and says through his teeth in an almost frenzied warning:** I am still inside here

**A silver teardrop runs down the outer corner of eyes, Gathers a bit of tear on a finger:** A little bit comes bleeding through

**looks at teardrop:** I wish this could have been any other way

**Yells upward and assumes fetal position:** Oh, but I just don\'t know, I don\'t know what else I can do

**Chants in a disturbed fashion from fetal position:** Every day is exactly the same; There is no love here, and there is no pain
