Prologue
========

Our story begins with two visitors to a place called \'sanctuary\'; though named as its purpose the hidden place more resembles a contemporary coffee shop. As such like any other with its sharp aroma of bitter drinks perhaps If not for peculiar visitors. The two in question being one artificial being named simply \'Kreen\' and another human Dee Thrummer. Now returned from an ill-fated jaunt to an illusory test just as ill-advised Kreen has developed a furry problem in the aftermath of a spell the machine\'s mind cannot properly perceive. This same test caused a problem for Dee as well as she gave the mage assassin a piece of her knuckles in lieu of her mind. Kreen was perhaps a contributor as the a black gauntlet around Dee\'s hand. The construct had changed to a weapon to better protect Dee in the coming test.

In the coffee house itself a host of familiar faces wait for her return: Feba and Xyules, dragons from a place where changelings dwell; Nycteris, a human wind mage who long since took issue with gravity and won; Schroe. a human from one world less of magic than many a patron; and Entril, a bound piece of the mage assassin Treshk\'s mind

Sugary Cure-All; Mind The Cavities
==================================

The door opened slightly, letting in a warm and humid draft. There was soft music playing in the background and the sound of kids running around. Dee started to walk through until loud complaints from her little ones about one more hug drew her back. She wedged the door open with her foot with a mockingly exasperated sigh.

A moment later she managed to get through the door without her adopted children stopping her. The young woman looked much better than she had before- the dark circles were gone from around her eyes, and her hair was laying flat for once. Her sword was separated back into two blades, and the gold was gone from her blue eyes. The electrokinetic was also smiling broadly.

\"Did Kreen and I miss anything?\" she asked.

It was most likely not how everyone would have expected to see her after hearing what she recently did to Treshk.

A dragon approaching human-sized answers her from above a steaming cup of tea at a nearby table.

\"Not really, Entril was just explaining the situation and the \'test\' before. And the fact that it seems that you beat us to the punch regarding Treshk.\" Xyules plainly states.

Dee blushed faintly. \"Ah, yeah, about that\...\.....I don\'t like it when people take advantage of my desire to protect people.\"

She sat down in her usual cross-legged position near the couch where Schr√∂e and Feba were. \"And I didn\'t get to my place of zen and peace quick enough,\" the electrokinetic said with a slight smirk. \"But, just spent an hour in the kitchen, and you\'d be amazed how much negative energy you can get rid of by stirring the living daylights out of a batch of cookie dough. Can\'t really say that I\'m all that sorry, though.\"

Entril is still holding her head to the side like she\'s listening. \"It seems Treshk is about to get his tooth grown back, as soon as old Vrimag is done healing Mech. Really, Dee, you didn\'t have to hit him that hard. It\'s not like you were actually protecting anyone.\"

Dee frowned. \"I didn\'t think I\'d hit him quite that hard, unless\...\...\...oh, oops, perhaps I do owe him an apology after all,\" she said sheepishly, recalling the added jolt that she hadn\'t really been able to control. \"But that really was an accident- originally it was supposed to just have been enough to get his attention.\"

Her eyes narrowed slightly when Entril\'s words completely sank in. \"Wait- healing Mech? What happened now?\"

Entril doesn\'t move from her listening position. \"Lemme check. Ooo, yeah, bet that stung. Poison needle to the arm. He\'s been given the antidote and healed, he\'s fine. Treshk is with him, after all. And Vrimag is the best healer that the Assassin\'s Guild has, so don\'t worry about Mech.\"

\"Assassin\'s guild?\" Dee said speculatively. \"Well, as long as he\'s ok\...\....as for Treshk being with him, that\'s what scares me. I can just see the two of them pulling some of the crazy stunts that Mech has tried in the past.\"

Entril is still listening. \"Oh gee, you should have seen the look on Mech\'s face when Treshk threw him across that pit to disable the traps from the other side. Crazy stunts indeed.\"

\"Exactly what I was afraid of,\" Dee said as she massaged her forehead with one hand. \"I don\'t think I want to know any more than that. Lady Anescia, I hope you\'re listening- keep an eye out for Trouble, please, Goddess.\"

\"Aw, don\'t worry, Dee. He didn\'t hit the wall that hard, and he got a good handhold right away. And he got a little bit of poison in him and won\'t feel the fingers on his left hand for a while, but he\'ll be fine.\"

Dee looked over the rims of her glasses at Entril. \"That isn\'t helping matters any,\" she said in a mockingly stern voice. \"Eh, I know he\'ll be fine, though. There have been worse scrapes before. A lot worse.\"

She fiddled with one of her bracelets. \"And besides, I\'m sure he\'ll be even more careful to come back in one piece this time\...\...\...\" the electrokinetic said with a hint of a mischievous smile.

Entril smiles. \"They\'re psychoanalyzing you now, Dee. Mech seems impressed. That healer will be a while, though, since it appears you broke his jaw.\"

\"Ok, definitely owe him an apology- I didn\'t mean to clock him nearly that hard,\" the young woman said with a wince.

\"\...Oh, I think Dee has expressed our annoyance sufficiently without more reinforcement of that level...it would just be petty anger and selfish rage now\...I believe that punishing someone twice in human law isn't allowed under something called 'double jeopardy', He got his punishment already. And I don't see a reason to be overly hostile towards him currently. " Xyules states.

Xyules looks at the tea and take a sip.

\"That said, I am annoyed at him still.\" Xyules finishes.

Entril shrugs. \"Eh, he\'ll live. His dad had given him worse by the time he was three. He\'s used to hard knocks.\"

Understated Preoccupation
=========================

\"Cripes, forgot about Kreen!\" Dee suddenly said, smacking herself upside the head with her free hand.

*\"Jeesh, you should have said something sooner! Looks like nothing is going to be happening for a while.\"*

Kreen replies to Dee with a cacophonous mewling in the background, *\"It is sorry it was busy\... whatever happen outside leave Kreen hip deep in animals. Leftovers of some illusion? Kreen has never seen the storm rain kittens before\...\*THUMPMEWFFT\"\"*

The construct clicks in exasperation after being struck to continue,*\"\*Click\* And they are still coming down at least until filters behind the bulwark are fixed\...\"*

The young woman arched one eyebrow. *\"Raining\...\...\...\...\....cats? That might have been because of Treshk\'s illusion. Um, anything I can do to help?\"* she asked.

Depressingly it replies, *((Kreen hates repairing things in astral self. Reality is too much a suggestion. Some parts started mewing hours ago then left so it has been wading through kittens to find furry gears ever since.))*

Amidst a lot of hissing it continues, *((The storm is emitting a lot of shards of illusion magic with which Kreen is incompatible it thinks. It does not help that machine needs a great deal of spare parts. Can friend Dee use the haft to vent all these shards out? However it is not sure exactly how large an effect Dee will amplify it to whatever friend Dee does with them.))*

\"Tell me what to do and I\'ll see if I can\'t help with that,\" Dee replied. *\"But perhaps it would be best not to do this in Safe Haven, no?\"*

Just beneath Kreen\'s voice can be heard an armful of metal-sounding meows as it answers, *((Back in coffee house already? Well seek out the pieces of illusion in its mind and call from from the haft. Machine will remove each from here and provide the energy to friend Dee through the haft. The weapon will rectify it how friend Dee desires. Perhaps is best go somewhere empty then, yes. Unless friend Dee knows of a place to put a few acres of kittens for a few hours until they dissipate\...))*

Dee laughed out loud when she thought of just what could be done with that. After chuckling for a moment she brought herself under control enough to reply, *\"Actually, I know just what to do with that many kittens\...\...\...hold on, let me tell everyone else that we\'ll be gone for a while.\"*

\"I\'m going to go help Kreen with a bit of a problem caused by some sort of residual energy from Treshk\'s illusion. We should be back soon enough,\" Dee said, still sounding very amused by whatever thought it was that had made her laugh just moments ago.

Nycteris drank her tea, looking decidedly weary. She glanced around at the group in the Haven, and then back to her tea, thoughts unspoken.

\"\...\...\.....And I\'m apparently talking to myself,\" Dee said. \"Eh, oh well.\"

She got to her feet and held her hand over the doorknob for a moment, trying to remember what Mech had told her about it. Just focus on a place and open the door- sounded simple enough. Hopefully it would work for where they were trying to reach. A faint scent of wisteria and lilacs drifted through the doorway on a warm breeze when she opened it, which made Dee smile. *\"Let\'s see if Lady Anescia likes illusion kitties- I\'m sure she won\'t mind if we use her woods,\"* the young woman told Kreen as she stepped through the door.

Obviously relieved Kreen replies, *((Lady Anescia? Is that the chaos goddess or is Kreen mistaken? Kreen thinks this should prove interesting\...))*

*\"Hmm-mm,\"* Dee replied to Kreen as she stepped into a wooded area. *\"She loves cats, and has a lot of space.\"*

On The Doorstep To Chaos
========================

The young woman didn\'t look where she was going while she spoke until she very nearly put her foot on an immaculate lawn which filled the clearing they had come to. She skipped back nervously. *\"And I wouldn\'t suggest going anywhere near her lawn. Looks pretty, but don\'t touch. It turns diamond sharp if you step on it or put something on her perfect grass. Better than a warning sign for keeping people off it.\"*

The construct\'s common loses its elegance outside of sanctuary\'s effect of translation though it nonetheless replies,*\"Yes not all grass like crushing. Vilyan not like it when lost step on her grass either. Whack them hard with stick instead. If Lady Anescia really like lots of cats about to have plenty?\"*

"*Hmm-mm. Now, what exactly do you need me to do?"* Dee inquired as she sat cross-legged in the middle of the stone path.

*\"Well friend Dee should think of haft not express as weapon. Haft is a tool that is always what friend Dee thinks it should be. In this friend Dee can manage expectations of haft where Kreen is limited. First must be able perceive all bits of kits.\" *

The construct continues in a placid tone, *\"Remember back to some time familiar and remembered clearly. Somewhere safe and predictable where friend Dee believes the haft was also. It need not be true that the haft was there only that friend Dee believes it was so. As haft follows friend Dee\'s mind the memory will touch Kreen\'s astral plane so these two will join for a time. Friend Dee must look for something that is changed from this. Field of full ants where none were? Apple trees with fuzzy tails for fruit? Everything that is here will be there also. Though if is black water or fire not seek for touching it.\"*

Dee smiled faintly. A familiar place\...\...\....that she could do. She focused on a memory of the Garden from when she was last there with Mech. It was an odd place, and most likely wouldn\'t seem all that predictable to anyone who didn\'t know it. The walls with the wisteria were ordinary enough, as were the many fountains and the distant lake, but several fruit trees and flowers were blooming together which shouldn\'t have been. There were also several paintings and photographs in ornate gold frames hanging in seemingly midair, including one of Mech and Dee standing together in front of some sort of building. After a moment the young woman added the belief that the haft was there. The water in a nearby fountain turned black, and she warily edged away from it.

*\"This is me staying away from that like you said,\"* she told Kreen as she surveyed her surroundings. A moment later Dee found what was out of place- quite a few dead leaves on one of her favorite trees.* \"Fah! I\'ve never had a dead leaf in the Garden before, except that one time when I thought Mech was dead and when I was mourning a friend. That\'s definitely the difference.\" *

Kreen strolls further away from the bulwark atop the border sea to escape the endless licking as it replies, *\"Kreen expected border sea manifest somewhere. Lots of that here. Still dangerous even as figment in mind of another. Maybe Kreen echo too but probably as something float on black stuff. Dead leaves likely then? Leaves dead from small things eating them or look different from leaves up close? Lots of kitten figments somewhere in there as Kreen knows not what. Must make what an\' where is is else make early fall for forest if try manifest dead leaves without certainty\... Lady probably not like that. Prepare for memory get more real as haft travel more in lockstep.\" *

*\"So remember where Dee left the friend Dee! Kreen hears friend Dee get lost in thought often so maybe is in familiar territory anyway.**\*khtkhtkht\***\", *It teases playfully.

*Me, get lost in thought?\"* Dee replied with mock surprise that Kreen would think such a thing. *\"Well, this certainly is familiar territory. Remember where I left myself\...\....? I assume you mean remember that this is just a memory, after a fashion? Border sea\...\....? Ach, never mind, you can explain later on\...\....I\'ll just keep away from it for now. And I\'m fairly certain that the leaves are definitely it- in my mind, I always leave my beloved cherry trees as reflections of the world I know. Maple leaves, even dead ones, don\'t belong on those branches.\"*

*\"Well must remember where left body \'cause haft slowly drift friend Dee deeper into own mind. Perhaps become more difficult for snapping directly awake. Friend Dee not drifted nearly close enough to bulwark to be risked though. Can friend Dee hear the forest anymore?\" *

*\"Friend Dee should think of way for remove all leaves at same time. Cyclone? How did Vilyan put it? As best in common\... **\*vvvvvt\*** \'Here is there, there is here. Where minds move a haft brought to bear.\'"*

*\"Ah, ok, makes sense,\" *Dee said.* \"Yup, I can still hear the woods, faintly. As for getting all of these leaves out\...\...\...hmm.\"*

She speculatively looked at the tree. After a moment she snapped her fingers and made a twirling motion with her hand. When the leaves barely fluttered, Dee frowned and repeated the motion a bit more insistently. The leaves came off the tree and spun in a slow circle about a foot away.* \"Ok\...\...\...so now it\'s just a manner of channeling these out?\" she asked, slightly confused and more than a little apprehensive about messing up. *

*\"Yes, friend Dee is the conduit between here and there. Friend Dee got something to work then? Look for bronze gears where the machine and so haft crosses mind with the real. More space in space than ought to be? Maybe see own body somewhere.\" *

As it detects a hint of hesitation Kreen offers consolingly, *\"If can find echo of own body put single leaf there to see what becomes before send all? Haft respond strongest atop body echo. Kreen also notes that also hear better when mental efforts logical. Machine is aware of emotion through voidfluid but not employ it.\" *

Small fissures outlined by bronze flicker in the environment near where the cyclone twirls but they don\'t seem to displace the area around them.

Echo of herself\...\....fun. Dee was glad to be learning something new, but this was a far cry from what she was used to. Yet again she was reminded just how instinctive most of the things that she did were. The young woman focused on the faint image that she thought could be herself and sent one of the leaves through the fissure, not sure what to expect. *\"Tell me if I\'m screwing things up,\"* Dee said nervously.

As the singular leaf passes the border into the real with sound reminiscent of a rustling leaf pile the mind thing gains a colored nimbus. Technicolor words fill out a rainbow nimbus of text that dissolves the object. A solidly round fissure opens around so the echo of the real is visible and a purple jolt impacts dead leaf. Now more unstable than ever before the image warps and distorts as the feather-light leaf quietly wafts toward Dee\'s lap. At a moment\'s touch the leaf snaps loudly like some pricked balloon into a whirling cyclone full to bursting amorphous bits of unrefined illusory energy. Though some leave view of the fissure, flung free to impact elsewhere, others turn into kittens of the surface they impact. Stone kittens, wood kittens, dirt kittens, grass kittens small balls of fluff soon made of everything. Even pants, shirt, hair, and Dee kittens are seen though they more resemble hairless cats. The dozen or two of 3\" long kittens scatter wildly out of view to parts unknown mewling all the way.

Kreen replies quietly if slightly confused, *\"Well\... Kreen barely able see what friend Dee doing from here. Did anything odd happen?\"*

Piles Of Fun
============

Dee opened one eye and quickly shut it again. *\"Oh, man, I\'ll say it did- that was just one of those shards? Did it work for getting that partially out of your system? If so, I\'ll get to work on the rest of this.\"*

Kreen chitters happily, *\"Yes Kreen thinks some left. Some get sucked toward Dee\'s mind and out at least specks few hundred meters away cross bulwark. Kreen still hip deep in kittens for several acres. It would guess there are many more leaves an\' probably more kittens released when more leaves rid at once?\" *

Dee looked at the leaves, which were still circling lazily. *\"Yup, we\'ve still got plenty left to do.\" *

She got to work sending as many leaves through the fissures as she could, trying not to laugh at the thought of what the place around her must look like. *\"Just a few more, and that should do it,\" *Dee said.* \"Unless I\'ve missed any\...\.....?\" *

Sucked through the barrier even with the forest fainter than normal the noise from these bursting leaves could be described as nothing less than a matchstick factory thrown at a fireworks warehouse and twice as colorful in the rather turgid air. The sheer avalanche of color and kittens exploding every which way leaves the Dee\'s body rapidly buried under the weight of writhing felines. Some are barely the newborn size of 3\" and others as tall at the shoulder as Dee herself. All kittens regardless fling themselves headlong into the forest in all directions with reckless abandon. Without any real anatomy the lemmings ignore any pitfalls and impacts and merely continue along their pinball routes through the swarm.

Kreen chitters madly while this occurs and shouts excitedly over the noise, *\"Yes! Kreen quite sure all are leaving \'cause large cloud writhing things gone from underfoot! Good riddance, Kreen is tired of bottom half being licked while trying fix machinery!\" *

Dee tiredly rubbed between her eyes. *\"Ow. Note to self\...\.....do not look at a sudden flood of illusion kittens, or have your ears unprotected when setting loose that many illusion shards.\"*

Kreen replies concernedly, *\"Sorry, Dee isn\'t injured Kreen hopes? Magic explosions not cause pressure at least an\' illusory things not usually weigh anything. **\*Mvvv\***\... friend Dee still is the correct colors it hopes at least. If back into body enough see illusion aftermath then exited mind place safely.\"*

*\"**\*Khtkhtkht\*** Probably see stars for little while if not colored mushroom cloud still raining shards.\" *

*\"Eh, I\'ll be fine. It\'s just the combination of the light and the noise\...\...wasn\'t expecting that. So that\'s what the little explosions that I\'m still seeing are\...\...\.....fun.\" *

She started laughing when she opened her eyes again and looked around her. *\"Oh, wow, that\'s just awful,\"* Dee said with a laugh. *\"No wonder that was bothering you. What on earth is Lady Anescia going to think? Certainly enough chaos around here now, I suppose.\"*

Kreen notes happily, *\"Well Lady Anescia must think something\... it thinks unlikely that anyone \*not\* heard or at least see it. Friend Dee is at ground zero if she on way here. Kreen thinks they take at least few days for dissipate properly. At least Kreen can fix things without its parts running away in some thing\'s mouth.\"*

Found Out
=========

Dee was about to reply when someone cleared their throat. \"Delilah Marie Adelphinae Thrumer, what in the name of chaos did you do?\"

\"You like cats, m\'lady, and a friend needed to get rid of a few,\" the young woman said as she bowed respectfully to the shorter and older woman who was standing on the path.

Anescia pushed a few strands of her hair away from her face as she surveyed her lawn. \"I just love your definition of \'a few\', my dear. Interesting\...\...I haven\'t seen this sort of illusion in over two centuries. So this is the chaos that you\'ve been up to of late, hmm? I must admit that I am rather surprised Mechintho isn\'t with you- found another partner in chaos, have we? Well. This is quite a pleasant surprise.\"

*\"Well, she\'s smiling,\" *Dee told Kreen. Out loud she said, *\"They should dissipate in a few days, or so Kreen believes.\"*

\"Kreen?\" Lady Anescia said. \"I believe I owe this friend of yours thanks, then.\"

Hesitant in hearing about a chaos Goddess smiling Kreen responds, *\"Smiling? Well Kreen has found things such as that are much like large dragons smiling. Often as good as bad. What is Lady Anescia saying?\" *

*\"That she should thank you for this chaos,\" *Dee said cheerfully. *\"Anything that you want me to tell her?\" *

Kreen chirps happily, *\"Good! Can have all the cats she wants\... Kreen is very tired of being licked! Can unclamp Kreen from haft now they are all free? Machine will reassemble the lost parts. It would like to meet this Lady Anescia as well.\"*

*\"Definitely!\"* Dee said cheerfully. *\"I think that you\'ll like her.\"*

She slid the gauntlet off her hand, a bit wary because she didn\'t quite know what to expect.

Once Dee removes her hand from the gauntlet it vanishes to suck back into the business end of the haft. The slider has turned itself idle in the center position by removal though Kreen is still clamped to the bottom.

Lady Anescia stood there quietly while Dee proceeded to unclamp Kreen, her dark brown eyes gleaming with a hint of laughter and the corners of her mouth turned up in the slightest of smiles. Only when Dee was putting both Kreen and the haft down did she speak. \"What interesting company you keep- it makes things so much more fun.\"

Once Kreen senses that it is no longer attached to the haft it waits a moment before expanding to normal size. Short while after Dee puts Kreen down the small gold marble rapidly inflates to the 2.5\' diameter travel sphere. The expansion rams a small impression in the road of the gold bound surface though the construct\'s warbling voice issues immediately to apologize.

\"EeEV\... SorRy aBOuT hOLe. KrEeN bE wITh yOu iN moMEnT.\"

Light lenses around the sphere very slightly as Kreen rises for a few inches of clearance. One bass airy sound begins as the travel sphere descends another form to Kreen\'s normal shape. Until the construct\'s form completes the small mantid body hovers in the air with four hands around its knees. Rose tinted field between gold bindings when finished dims as Kreen lets go of its legs.

Kreen bends down in a bow as much to retrieve its haft as it greets Lady Anescia, \"Kreen is glad to meet Lady Anescia. It has been told kind \*HURVVVT\*\"

The construct jerks violently to hack out yet another kitten. Pure onyx and gemlike the remnant seems disoriented instead to just lay down and purr harmonically.

Kreen continues with a twinge of distaste, \"Eevv\... kind things. It glad Lady Anescia likes them; Kreen had quite enough.\"

\"Hmm, yes, cats are such wonderfully chaotic creatures,\" Lady Anescia said as she bent to pick up the final cat. \"Throw even one or two into any equation and they cause such mayhem\...\...\....as I\'m quite sure you know by now.\"

She lightly stroked the cat\'s shoulders, smiling. \"The pleasure is mine, to be sure. My problem about a suitable mess for that next group which I have penciled into my schedule is more than solved now.\"

Kreen chitters, \"Helping others by cause trouble is always amusing to Kreen. Kreen is happy to help friend Dee regardless. The red hoppers inside of Kreen are not nearly as much trouble as illusory cats.\"

Home With Questionable Chaperone
================================

Kreen turns to Dee and asks, \"Will friend Mech be back to coffee house by now? Unless wish to stay here for while if Lady not mind. It live forever; in no hurry.\"

\"Cripes, by now they\'re probably back\...\...\....and I need to apologize to Treshk for hitting him so hard,\" the young woman said sheepishly.

Lady Anescia smiled. \"And to check on your dear little gremlin- I assume that he\'s doing well, since you haven\'t asked me to watch out for him again. Perhaps you could come visit another time; company is most certainly welcome. The more chaotic the better.\"

Kreen nods at Dee, \"Then can come back another time? It hopes person Treshk treat Mech well.\"

The construct looks about distractedly as its eyes glow slightly trying to ascertain where the plane is to be able to get back to it. The glow fades as it queries Lady Anescia, \"Kreen happy to visit again sometime with Dee. Plane safe for direct travel to visit or must use door? It gets disoriented if hit plane envelopes barring transit.\"

\"Hmm? Oh, it\'s quite safe for direct travel,\" Lady Anescia said with a grin. \"Like I said, company is welcome. Very rarely do I get visitors who just come to sit and talk- besides, getting here shouldn\'t be the hard part, even for unwelcome visitors.\"

Dee commented under her breath about it being harder for such guests to leave than arrive, which made the Anescia smile broadly.

\"But of course! Couldn\'t have it any other way\...\....some days I even practice on my own, as you well know,\" Lady Anescia said with an exaggerated wink. \"Well, I shan\'t keep the two of you, so long as you come to visit some other time. Dee isn\'t saying anything, but she\'s quite worried about how Mech fared with this Treshk person.\"

Kreen nods, \"Yes\... Kreen thinks it used to more about the person Treshk than it does now. Machine tamper with its memories worries Kreen more than one person. Means Machine sees person Treshk\'s people as threat to sphere bearer.\"

A doorway appeared on the path beside her. \"Since you used a door to get here, I\'ll provide the way back. I must admit that it was quite a pleasure, and that the cats were such a delightfully chaotic surprise. Be sure to come back soon, and chaos to guide your steps until then!\"

 Over to Dee Kreen reaches up to take her hand with one side of its own and says, \"Not worry friend Dee, Kreen will go with her to see that friend Mech is okay.\"

\"Thanks, Kreen,\" Dee replied, giving the mantid\'s hand a squeeze while she used her other hand to open the door. She was even more worried if the Machine saw Treshk as a danger, but the young woman said nothing about her misgivings. \"I really appreciate that.\"

Kreen waves goodbye with its other hands to Lady Anescia, \"Kreen promises will be back again sometime soon! Maybe as a free being if things go well. Kreen can hope.\"

\"Well, I\'ll hold you to that!\" Lady Anescia said as she waved back. \"And if you ever have need of anything, tell that high priest of mine that he is to do anything in his power to help.\"

Kreen nods and looks toward the door while at its height Kreen looks like a toddler reaching up to Dee\'s hand. Kreen pushes the door open a bit then leads on into the coffee house their short jaunt at a close.
