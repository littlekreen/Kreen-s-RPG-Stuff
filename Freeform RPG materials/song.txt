** breaks one ball and chain and throws to the ground to start the song

Sail away where no ball and chain
Can keep us from the roarin' waves

** Leans off the stage at an abnormal angle hands back as if in the spray of the dea

Together undivided but forever we'll be free

** hands clenched in pairs and shaken up in strong handshakes at the wrists before freeing them and making rude gestures at the each other side of hands

So sail away aboard our rig

** lets go of hands and makes a sweeping motion away from the stage with one hand outstretched palm toward a far window

The moon is full and so are we

** the outstretched palm changes to a pointing finger and moves to point at the moon then points to itself

We're seven drunken pirates
We're the seven deadly sins

** kreen's hands come up and back as if to present the group to all
** chorus: bards join in with kreen to establish existance of the chorus
** bards start in with driving music

** kreen leaps off stage and bouncing lightly off of patrons and architecture alike rockets across to the center of the room with ball and chains whipping around but carefully controlling them as to not harm a single tankard.
** Lands on patron's table and lets go of chains as the metal spheres thunk to the table.

So the years rolled by and several died
And left us somewhat reelin'

** Leans backward off toward a patron with four hands on face but then bends back forward again

Johnny strummed his Tommy gun

** Kreen grabs two tankards from the patron's table and pushes them just out of sync enough with the plane to shortly drift back

Left blastin' through the ceiling

** tosses tankards at the cieling allowing the tankards to pass but the ale to rain down. Both materialize in the room above and clatter to the floor.

So what became of rebels

** Kreen draws a small short sword from its belt

Who sang for you and me?

** shakes sword in the air defiantly
** looks at a patron on a different table, motions to them with sword
** motions to self with sword

Grapplin' with their demons

** Grabs bindings at center of chest and pull them wide
** faces of the lost souls roving within push forward into view at the strain.

In the search for liberty

** Releasing its bindings they jerk into place
** rattles the manacle on its neck

Sufferers who suffer all

** Jams the short sword in its chest and spins it in place

Can swim upon the desert

** waggles sword back and forth like a fish while making swimming motions

Where avarice have ravaged all

** produces four silver coins 
** Goes to bended knee and holds them up to the light as if in prayer

In spite of good intentions

** stands up with a shot and with a flick of the wrist fires the coins off to shatter four local tankards
** lightly hops to a different table across the way with clinking chains
** grabs four more tankards

Don't fill your mouth with gluttony

** brings all four tankards upright to mouth

For pride will surely swell

** Spreads its hand up and wide holding the tankards high
** Leans its waist out somewhat and pushes wings out to look as if it grows a belly

But nothing's unforgiven in the four corners of hell

** pours the tankards out onto the table and upon the mention of hell bursts into a wreath of black flame, freezing the streams of beer close by solid
** stifles the flame quickly after as to avoid frosting the patrons around the edges 

Sail away where no ball and chain
Can keep us from the roarin' waves
Together undivided but forever we'll be free
So sail away aboard our rig
The moon is full and so are we
We're seven drunken pirates
We're the seven deadly sins
We're seven drunken pirates
We're the seven deadly sins

Envy and its evil twin
It crept in bed with slander
Idiots they gave advice
But sloth it gave no answer
Anger kills the human soul
With butter tales of lust
While pavlov's Dogs keep chewin'
On the legs they never trust

Sail away where no ball and chain
Can keep us from the roarin' waves
Together undivided but forever we'll be free
So sail away aboard our rig
The moon is full and so are we
We're seven drunken pirates
We're the seven deadly sins
We're seven drunken pirates
We're the seven deadly sins

But It's the only life we'll know
Blagards to the bone
So don't wreck yourself
Take an honest grip
For there's more tales beyond the shore

Ah the years rolled by and several died
And left us somewhat reelin'
In and out came crawlin' out
And spewed upon the ceiling
So what became of rebels"
That sang for you and me
Grapplin; with their demons
In the search for liberty

Sail away where no ball and chain
Can keep us from the roarin' waves
Together undivided but forever we'll be free
So sail away aboard our rig
The moon is full and so are we
We're seven drunken pirates
We're the seven deadly sins

Sail away where no ball and chain
Can keep us from the roarin' waves
Together undivided but forever we'll be free
So sail away aboard our rig
The moon is full and so are we
We're seven drunken pirates
We're the seven deadly sins
We're seven drunken pirates
We're the seven deadly sins
We're seven drunken pirates
We're the seven deadly sins
