On Suffering

\"Human suffering?\", Kreen responds as it quietly carves a stone with its ebon blade

\"Yes, Kreen knows enough about this.\"

Antennae angle back sharply as Kreen offers in an acerbic tone, \"Kreen will tell you something about it.\"

\"Leaders, murderers, \" Kreen clacks once, \"those that often are both. So many too eager by half to merely watch suffering or send others to bring suffering then experience it diluted by quarter at least. Tears of blood reduced to ink for numbers or words upon letters or pictures devoid of context.\"

Fluid to fetch one of its daggers Kreen jams this metal spike downward into its head. Between eyes Kreen wriggles the dagger saying, \"Ever infested others with things to draw out information? Wriggling and scratching inside the bones. After a time the mind slows as much as its resistance. In that short span these relentless invaders can draw many things in against a strong will.\"

\"Waking up in a dark hole with legs eaten useless. Still hope against hope that someone will come. Even so doubt wails past the teeth raging inside substance of thought to a voice already too hoarse from screaming to call further. Only after staring at it numbly through the shallow hole is a city, home, seen through the smoke and flames of its buildings. Where hope once was, where family is hoisted on pikes and where the rescuers once were.\"

Black ichor drips down the knife etching a furrow then cratering into the floor. As it jitters between branches growing out of the mass and crystals Kreen continues to grind at its self-imposed wound.

\"After that the hope just drains out of the spirit. The lost respite of beleaguered minds seeks faith that there is one place their faith. Reality is more persistent than most would like as it reminds of the torturers cold touch, malice in a stare that ares to torture beyond goals simply to cause pain, or deep darkness that permeates its shadow creeping inside the hole.\"

\"Even strong minds cannot hold out forever, to give into the insanity, a furious mind tries to stare obscenities into the oppressor atop this grave with grasped shovel. Cursed form jabbing its implement of murder into loose earth as a shovel full of dirt gets flung, out of spite, at a newly terrified face.

One last resistance scatters like the same dry dirt just as that last working expression of hatred falls to terror. Small pebbles hit like boulders against a much abused torso where wriggling bumps gnaw from inside lash wounds. Panicked strength tries feebly to throw away dirt that quickly piles about the ears but with only a weakly nodding head hardly saves anyone from feelings of futility mired in rage.

Bile comes last but acceptance rarely does; taking pleasure that the thing can do no more harm once they die. Their torturer holds no such preconceptions as the dirt goes higher and euphoria comes closer. So close to staying alive in but a few inches of dirt but too weak to save their own life.

Kreen shakes a fist of one hand and shouts, \"Bastard! Why must I die like this! Why\... I just want to know why.\"

One blast of noise serves for a sigh in the construct\'s weary demeanor as it laments coldly, \"Both man and woman beg about as often. Pride is rarely a consolation. If they had shut up Kreen might have gotten bored then. Then, Kreen could have stopped when its targets died, but to kill them all was cleaner. No witnesses, no tall tales, nothing to lead back to Darkavien. Clack Just to avoid Darkavien\'s notice of Kreen\'s activities. It didn\'t matter in the end, but Kreen wonders.\"
