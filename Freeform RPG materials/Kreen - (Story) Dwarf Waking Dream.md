Quietly waiting at the gate marking the threshold of friend Bitflipper\'s mind Kreen played the machine in a game of cards. It was a boring thing to be true as both could count cards but it kept Kreen\'s mind busy. Here Kreen bides its time outside the last bulwark reigning in a raging storm at the very edge of its plane. A small hole into the fast floor of gears Kreen looks up the stairs into the raging storm raining down a black ichor that galed past grated stairs into the gears beyond.

The lost were angry; that was plain to see. They were always angry. Kreen had given itself as a weapon to its friend Bitflipper as a small gold orb connected to its weapon haft. As this meant this shotgun was armed it gave cause for the lost to look for a vulnerable Kreen roaming the flats. Machine gave it some protection out its existence but little else. The machine cared less about Kreen than the host of lost souls.

These two halves of the same massive artifact bunker here in poor quarters assuming the lost would not find them here; One the essence of the storm, the other a shackle with which to bind. Kreen knew it was vulnerable to them but then it was made of them. So much anger and hate. The machine was immune in its structured mind of the highest order but Kreen was a thinking being. It looked out again at the storm as it thinks, being afraid of the guilt the lost can wrack all their misery come from Kreen\'s murder.

Murder is a careful thing, quiet and unfeeling, but still implies that one knows right from wrong. The machine knew neither and held the reins of Kreen\'s mind to execute its master\'s will. Darkavien was little better that the machine in that respect in that he simply did not seem to care about others that were in his warpath. Nonetheless it felt beholden to all the suffering it had caused and stood to stand at the bottom of the stairs.

The toddler-sized mantid had none of the gold bindings its outer self possessed as here it was stable as much as the word applied. Here its will was weak. The machine repaired quickly to swords and daggers but walking the flats machine offered no protection to the mind. Once it\'s mind had that same burn for the ends of murder, come from Darkavien, but no more. Once used in its full purpose Kreen gained knowledge of what it had truly done. Flashed in blast knowledge of why the will to murder was wrong. The memory of its victims poured in as in the beginning of its endless lifetime of grief. In this first mass murder it screamed alongside them in misery. Now it only wished to give surcease to the endless death it had wrought.

Toward the machine Kreen looked listlessly as it waited for forever to the next hand in the quiet Kreen used to enjoy. Though here it can think clearly the two halves no longer saw eye to eye on murder. There was too much guilt for it to tarry long. Even if it could not offer the freedom both it and the lost sought at least it could give them vengeance to quiet their pain for a time. At least until the machine would again make them forget.

Kreen clenched its four hands and said to them, \[i\]\"At least is still not enough.\"\[/i\]

Full of resigned purpose Kreen climbs the metal stairs with toed feet gaining the thump of a boot. As it climbed the stairs Kreen knew the lost are now here. The thin humanoid body of an insectoid body begins to warp as much as this point of mind. Limbs inflate to produce boots, arms to make fingers filling gauntlet, then lastly its body gives way to that of a dwarf at the scale of the stair.

Little more remained of what was but two spots of blackness where eyes used to be. The lost that came for Kreen was strong among them but as missing as the rest for the lack of his mind. He had a name once, Kreen was sure. Kreen was angry at itself for being unable to remember but both relented at the futility. The lost looked at his hands, strong dwarven hands, but could not remember for the life of him to whom they belonged.

One singularly large stained window hostel lies not far away in contrast to the endless red brass floor and gear work. Perfectly flat, perfectly ordered, and no feeling to any of it. The lost dwarf harrumphed at this soulless construction and moved on. At first he goes past small planter boxes of gear sprouting mushrooms then to more normal plants and a few flowers. Kreen didn\'t want to go, it didn\'t want to remember, but it had to be done. Now at the threshold of the large inn a flagon sign with missing label swings overhead. The familiar squeak is quiet and comfortingly regular to him but Kreen reaches up instead to arrest the sign and make the noise stop. The order that imprisons, the order that lays waste to fond memory, the lost dwarf could not bear to hear it. On that day long ago Kreen heard the sign make the same sound, confident and regular, the familiar swing that calls dwarf one and all to merry drinking. He\'d had many a good memory at this place as for a moment this fleeting memory made the dwarf smile. This happy moment felt natural and strong that suppressed a dry throat hoarse like he\'d been screaming for far too long.

The door was already open and Kreen took the first step inside to perhaps see if the place still held a drink for this dwarf\'s parched throat. Furnishings of this place were forged with as most careful hand caressed a wooden chair. Kreen knew what the inn tried to hide; What we designed with so much love. Something a dwarven hand can use to push the undead back into their dark. Such a hard few years. He\'d lost many just in construction and their names were etched in the bricks that his mind couldn\'t seem to hold onto. Names and faces just slipped through his mind as a furrowed dwarven brow tries to make sense of the meaningless scratches adorning hundreds of bricks by the entrance.

With a sigh of resignation the dwarf moves on to the bar and sits on a stool. If only it were warm here. Cold still suffused the air so very much and Kreen felt for a moment sad that it could not light a warm fire here. It couldn\'t feel anything but though the dwarf wouldn\'t admit it the endless frigid air bit so very much. He couldn\'t remember all that too far of the time spent earlier but the piercing cold was unforgettable. There was someone he called out to so that the cold would go away. Kreen wished that the deity chipped and unrecognizably worn on the mantle could come to help them. At least he was fairly sure the deity was as useless for warmth as the fireplace it marked.

It was little use to wait for someone to come to this beautiful place anymore. If there was a bartender or patrons here both are long since gone. Off the metal stool the dwarf made his way to this useless fireplace. Such a shame the mantle is so abused. It was meant to be the centerpiece of a building forged to honor a God. Not even the church got so much love as this alehouse did. Kreen saw the plain stone thing on its way in and barely a window did it have. The statues inside and the building itself were crafted with care to be sure but even the stone walls in the alehouse pisser were decorated with motifs. The image made Kreen laugh so much. Forgotten God, how long had it been since last he laughed?

There was little to laugh for during the construction of this place. Something had made a fortress out of the lower end of their mine and was unhappy at the dwarfhold finding the vermin\'s home. Many that fought to defend this place every day during construction ought to be interred in the stone walls and foundation. All those listed at the threshold of the entrance. First the clan, Never to surrender! Kreen gave a wry grin at the war cry. The things from the dark knew the clan\'s slogan as much as the dwarves. They gave no mercy on their extinctive forays to man, woman, or child. Though we won for the longest time at last the strongest came. Kreen simply took time to arrive and we never really stood a chance at winning the battle. The dead were merely buying time to keep us at bay.

The pinnacle of craft hardened to attacks of months of undead horde incorporeal and otherwise fell first. The clerics fired first at Kreen who came offering to take their surrender. Back then Kreen\'s heart had no interest in wasting the time but Darkavien felt the blow to their honor was more useful. That was all the action Kreen needed to begin its last siege of the city. Firm to attacks of bow and blessing, Kreen, the single small undead thing at their walls blew adamantite and lead apart like so much shale with a single blow. Shrapnel from the explosion executed everyone defending the gates. Countless small metal missles of our own creation flayed defenders that none could recognize them. Then the thing walked away for a day. Kreen walked away from the murder heartless as if done with its hammering for the day.

The next day Kreen spent putting itself back together. The defenders actually did give it great harm. We instead dared not pursue the attacker into deep and dark with so many dead and leave the hold lightly defended. Instead we tried to rebuild the gate. What fools we. In the pursuit of expedience the smiths ignored advice of their clerics and did not add the lining of metal. This final ignorance was our last spike in the spine.

The dwarf\'s strong accent intoned mockingly, \[i\]\"Such a soft thing could not surely defend!\"\[/i\]

Once healed the next day Kreen wasted no time in making final the damage it had done. Hidden in shadows our remaining guard, vigilant and veteran, did not notice the creature\'s approach. Only one look at our failure of a door is what Kreen needed to begin its assault. Wraiths and shadow find no issue of rebuff from steel.

The dwarf stood up and walked to a window facing outside showing the endless brass plain where the gate would be beyond long ago. Beyond a few feeble planters badly lying at imitation of their intended subject there was as little there as what really was that day. Shadows came first, at least forty in ranks, to wade through the gate and siege the clerics from all sides. Thusly occupied wraiths came next with few to oppose them. Many of those guarding their home fell to wraiths made from the souls of their women and child. Just one day is what we needed. Just one day to forge the keyboard and we could have pushed them all away forevermore. Instead once the guard retreated far enough to be cut off they came for us.

We huddled here for safety as if a hammer without a mallet could fend off even the smallest rat. This building was our last impotent stand. I even sat there by that fireplace praying for the warmth of our nameless God. No help came when that same creature, Kreen, broke down the wooden door. It made short work of hapless recruits and veteran alike. Most were too weak to put up a fight at all. Kreen tore them apart while the innocent watched. There was nothing left to scream as I was hit with the flying limbs of my brothers hewn out of their bodies by bare hand. Our last healer and cleric tried in vain to fend it off and was impaled with a spear from chest to head. I can still hear him crying out to that nameless God.

The dwarf hangs his head and closes empty black eyes and lets a tear hit the windowsill as a grieving dwarven voice cracks, \[i\]\"No. No, it\'s so cold here. Help me. Don\'t let it take me away. Please! It\'s cold here, but I don\'t want to be here. It\'s cold here.\"\[/i\]

The dwarf returns to a fireplace bench where once he warmed and collapses in grief with his head in his hands. Kreen\'s voice instead intones in sorrow, \[i\]\"Kreen wanted to murder them all. To add nothing to Darkavien\'s knowledge that it was not directed to seize. It is sorry, so very sorry.\"\[/i\]

The dwarf\'s body shrunk away to Kreen\'s thin form as it speaks to the empty room in its native draconic, \[i\]((It came and killed everyone then took the plans to your building. So terse a way machine referred to its completion. It agreed without complaint. Without any suffering conscience at all. Kreen cannot expect any lost to forgive Kreen for what it did.))\[/i\]

Blood leaks from where Kreen\'s toes touch the floor as spite fuels the spread of a rushing coat of crimson. The dwarf\'s body once more pushes outward as the plain stone inn changes as the dwarf remembers what the construct did next. The hateful thing born of a lack of any goodness at all. Skulls and bodies of those stacked on the walls bob out of the blood coating the walls like a giant pool returning to the positions that they once took. Lost of many description and number begin to flood into the room as bodies take shapes of the people they once were.

The dwarf dying from wounds and trapped under an upturned bench he watched the construct drag in bodies of these wounded or dead. Hundreds of undead scoured the city for these bodies which all came here. Piled on the walls, on the tables, lain over the rafters, he watched as all the murder was brought to bear witness to itself. When his family and brothers finally arrived he cried till he could not cry any more. It had taken time but the undead had found the place they hid the unarmed. Most of the clan that resisted were not even offered an honorable death let alone the children and infirm. Those that still could breathe suffocated under the weight of their brethren.

The crimson floor rushes up all walls to wreath the building in fire and broken bodies that emerge from nothing. The lost can still be seen twitching broken eyes and bodies. All the gazes center on the dwarf as he screamed aloud, \[i\]\"TAKING OUR LIVES WAS ENOUGH! WHY DESECRATE OUR REMAINS TOO?\"\[/i\]

Kreen couldn\'t answer in a way that could ever satisfy. It didn\'t have one reason but rote. These piles of bodies and murder in mass could form a more powerful form of natural undead to bind to Darkavien\'s wishes. At this end Kreen piled bodies in the once-beautiful inn to use them as nothing but tools. And undead must have an unjust end to rise though then Kreen hardly needed to deliberate whether to do such desecration but how to go about it. The undead were obedient as Kreen ordered them to retrieve anything that could burn. Every document that came to their hands Kreen read but felt nothing at love letters and family portraits. Things that reminded of the happy times were then just meaningless relics of someone else\'s unrelated life.

The dwarf raged at all the precious things and lives that the construct discarded for piling like garbage in spoiling for one last fight. Weight from the stone bench pinning him savagely bit into his side and many broken ribs put him back down. He hurled obscenities at the construct piling the building with lamp oil and things that burn. Flung flaming coals at the undead dragging furniture and clothing to which the construct merely looked and turned away to ignore him.

Only once the doors from this common area of song and drink were crammed ceiling high of arms and things that burn did Kreen come to the dwarf architect. He had something Darkavien wanted; the rest were merely obstacles. Kreen pulled the slider on its weapon haft bearing a barbed spear of red brass from its top to spit in poor common at the dwarf, \[i\]&\#147;Be silent then die.&\#148;\[/i\]

The dwarf looked at this spot underneath stone bench where he last lay as the same barbed spear appeared in his hand. With a scowl of disgust and hate he jams the spear straight into stone that gives a sickening fleshy crack as bodies leave that stink of death to take full form in this room of what was. Force from the charnel\'s odor hit him just as hard as that spear once did long ago. This time, for one moment, the bodies were all here with ears to listen. Though he could not do much for them any more than himself the dwarf could help them forget. Perhaps it was best.

The dour dwarf stumped up to the bar he carved with his two hands and climbed up. A bard had been there before their last stand and left that morning. Strong and full of hope it left them and the dwarf hoped it could sing the song once more to assuage the eternal wounds of his brother and sister dwarves. Deep voice rang loudly in the air as he sung the words that once gave them strength.

Now you all know bards and their songs

when hours have gone by

I\'ll close my eyes

In a world far away

We may meet again

but now hear my song

about the dawn of the night

Let\'s sing the bard\'s song

Eyes from shattered faces and torn bodies fly open at the refrain as hundreds of voices join him in song. A thin confidence raises despite everything.

Tomorrow, will take us away

Far from home

Noone will ever know our names

But the bard\'s songs will remain

Tomorrow will take it away

The fear of today

It will be gone, due to our magic songs

Though he is angry with what the construct had done the dwarf is not without compassion. This lost soul is of few strong among the many that can feel the remorse and misery this view of the past causes Kreen. As the music breaks between last chorus the dwarf heads to the door by way of a stool. As he walks toward the front door he begins the last refrain on time sung just as loudly.

There\'s only one song, left in my mind

Tales of a brave man, who lived far from here

Now the bard\'s songs are over, and it\'s time to leave

No one should ask you for the name of the one

Who tells the story

Tomorrow, will take us away

Far from home

Noone will ever know our names

But the bard\'s songs will remain

Tomorrow all will be known

And you\'re not alone

So don\'t be afraid of the dark and cold!

He opens the door and Kreen is flung free to crumple to the ground and sob to itself in a ball. Looking on sadly the dwarf closes the tavern door slowly completing the last refrain as the building bursts into thick red smoke that evaporates in the air.

Cause the bard\'s songs will remain

All will remain.

In a long moment Kreen lies there full of remorse for what it had done. As the abject misery abates Kreen staggers to its feet and makes its way back to the safety of the machine. As it walks down the stairs Kreen still flickers into dwarven shapes before entering the machine\'s awareness. Nonetheless it manages a brave tone when speaking to its friends.
