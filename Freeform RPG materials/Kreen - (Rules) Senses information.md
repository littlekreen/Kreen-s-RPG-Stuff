Kreen\'s Senses
===============

Sight
-----

Can see above IR to UV (tetrachromat)

Able to rectify higher level space to sight willfully (high mental exertion)

Binocular but has no eyelids to close

Aware of energy fields for unlife, life, or general magic but has low detail

Senses reduced to human norms in areas with suppressed srying

Cannot see those immune to scrying

Active illusions are improperly interpreted

Hearing
-------

Human average acuity plus infrasonic range

Sound positioning accurate as a human

Hears with antennae

Smell
-----

Little sense of smell

All smells severely diminished with ashen scent from internal dust

Smells with antennae

Touch
-----

Below human norms

Cannot feel temperature very well as its surface is usually kept around 20 Celsius

Can feel pressure to surface as normal

Poor sense of pain

Taste
-----

Poor sense of taste

Tastes with antennae

Everything tastes like cheese as that is the only things it ate before conversion

No willful control of mandible arms while eating though they are responsive to general thought

Absorbs gaseous hydrogen or splits in stomach from water, emits ozone but cannot taste it.

Matter
------

Matter is extremely psyhoreactive

Deforms around strong psionic fields and is useless for weaponry without a tool to employ it as such

Kreen can project its matter outside by deforming mesh (concentration)

Matter is retained by wall of force projected by mesh

Mesh energy replenishes at finite rate

Control 
--------

Has control of avatar without effort but internal selves are willful

Mandibles are autonomous with sensitivity and preference to material with high energy levels

Internal selves are maintained as long as focus is maintained

Internal selves can only be pushed into existence from nearby facets

Disorganized coherent focus expresses itself as facets

Facets are not under direct control and serve as an unconscious

Facets reflect Kreen\'s ID and are very simple as well as impulsive

Kreen cannot hear itself think and must speak out loud

Objects passing through avatar body severely hinder control

Detached limbs remain under Kreen\'s control until discharged

Head never discharges unless heavily damaged as it is its connection point

Form
----

Kreen\'s avatar is sectional

Limbs, torso, pelvis, and antennae can be ripped off/detached

Mesh is self-repairing though faster in orb form

Forms are different mesh energy states (Avatar -&gt; Sphere -&gt; Catalyst)

Movement in any state but avatar can be affected by strong thought

Takes less energy expenditure and time to revert from forms than to switch to them.

Orb
---

Senses are only energy sense, hearing, and positional senses

Very slow movement in 3d space (floating, &lt; 1" a second)

In multiverse space Kreen can impulse into very high speeds.

Cannot steer well at interplanar speeds or slow down quickly

Can intersect a plane instead of passing through to join it but risks being merged in objects

Approximately 2 feet wide, dense mesh

Catalyst
--------

Amplifies and lenses energy projected through it, outside of Kreen\'s control

No senses whatsoever

Cannot revert while on another sentient being\'s person

Gravity responsive, .5kg marble sized metal sphere

Amplifying energy uses Kreen\'s energy.

Can be mounted onto the haft and inserted into weaponry to enhance its effects or will effects into existence.
