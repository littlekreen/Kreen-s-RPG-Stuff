Interior Plane of the Artifact Kreen
====================================

General Properties 
-------------------

**Material Plane**

**Time: Normal** - The plane\'s time ticks along evenly however the inner spaces will inherit the flow of time for the plane on which Kreen\'s external self is present.

**Morphic Traits: Sentient, Alterable Morphic**

**Weakly Law Aligned:** This plane is composed of a construct and as such has an affinity for order unless otherwise specified. Alignment largely depends on the distinct area within the subplane.

**Infertile -- **Only creatures that are native to the plane can breed here. Any other living creature will be unable to breed here. Sentient creatures entering the plane while carrying children must make a fortitude save DC 5 + 1 per day of exposure or risk the child dying immediately. If the parent makes the save but has the child within the plane the child must make a will save DC 15 on birth or die in 1d3 days and gain the zombie template.

The Fringe
----------

This area is the very border of the demiplane to the rest of the multiverse. Sparse and desolate it rarely has any features to speak of. What features it does have are an endless plain of gears composing the \'floor\' and a bulwark that retains an inky sea with the storm as an impossibly high roiling cloud in the distance.

**Gravity: &lt;50\', Objective Directional Gravity; &gt;50\', None** - Here down is slanted slightly inward toward the bulwark within 50\' of the floor making the fringe an endless downward slide toward the bulwark for those on the ground. Above this point the pull of gravity ceases and air circulation is entirely due to the endless churning wind from eddies along the storm\'s barrier

**Size: Self-Contained** -- This plane is a massive flat ring from the bulwark to the very edge of the reality where a vacant mist resides. This place is of stellar size in diameter however and from the point of view of a medium creature will appear to be perfectly straight until disappearing into atmospheric haze.

### The Bulwark

A 100\' tall wall that retains a very deep sea of inky blackness and a fierce thunderstorm along the horizon

**Gravity: Objective directional** -- Down is more consistent here as perpendicular to the sea of blackness surrounding the storm

**Size: Finite** -- This area is from the bulwark itself to 100 miles further in where the barrier to the storm subplane begins

The Storm
---------

A raging torrent of negative energy at such pressures that the entirety is in a liquid state.

**Strongly Chaos and negative aligned** -- Though there are doldrums here occasionally created by the machine this area as a whole is an unstable unlivable soup in in which the parts of the necromantic machinery that operates this demiplane draw their motive force from.

**Size: Self-contained** -- This area technically has only one real surface which curves as a ring and is a vast storm from a barrier 100 miles inward from the bulwark. It appears to continue forever toward the center, until stopping at The Eye a vast distance inside. Without a key to get out or a window opened through the barriers one will merely appear on the far end of the barrier from where they attempted to exit. If one could look left or right through the storm facing inward the other side of one\'s head could be seen with an infinite number of views expanding in a grid.

**One Way Trip** -- Nothing that enters the storm may leave it without use of a gate key, action on behalf of the artifact, or divine intervention. All things that enter this area act as if under a continuous dimensional anchor spell upon entry. If the spell-like effect is resisted or dispelled it only suppresses the effect for 1d6 turns after which it recurs. Gates from outside the plane, ones without the appropriate key, attempting to reach further in to the eye or the city instead deposit into the storm.

The Eye
-------

This area is the central hub of the outer layers that contains a number of barrier fields to reduce planar pressure to something livable by normal creatures on its inner dimensions and filter the material emitted by the storm.

**Size: Self-contained** -- This area is a more than 600 mile radius sphere

**Gravity: Objective directional** -- In this area there is a faint gravity away from the center of the spherical area toward the storm\'s barrier. The area between the last barrier and the storm will result in a fall rate four times that of the city itself so all falling damage and weight is quadrupled.

**Hostile environment -- **The area is largely an amalgam of vented gas and solid material thus is toxic to breathe. Roll 1d3 times on Table x-1 for each quarter mile of travel. Anyone entering the eye must bring their own air supply and even skin contact with the air results in D4 poison damage per round per barrier away from the city. Items take acid damage instead which bypasses hardness under 5 for non-magical materials.

**Explosive Gas -- **This area has a great deal of gas with a reactive potential if given a spark.

**Corrosive gas -- **While the material in this area is not explosive it is still quite caustic and causes damage to be within the cloud

**Unstable natural portals -- **Portals sometimes form in the eye due to the amount of force produced there on a regular basis and space is worn very thin by the chaotic space. These portals do stretch to accommodate what passes through it but the unstable portal does not maintain the continuous nature of matter very well. These losses of stability produce small slashes of disconnected matter for things that pass through.

**Accelerated time -- **The space in the eye is strained by the amount of tidal force generated by the storm. As such space does occasionally get damaged or its properties strained and this results in temporary losses of the uniformity of time. Time in these spaces progresses faster than normal though a sentient\'s awareness does not. If a human were to pass through these areas even quickly several weeks of time may pass for them and result in starvation.

**Worn space -- **The storm\'s presence sometimes damages the integrity of space itself and things within its confines rapidly accumulate damage as the instability of the area builds up around them. Every round anything passing into this area gains 1 hp of damage per round and stacks with itself.

**Grounding area -- **The equipment of the city uses this area as a dumping ground and a contact point of the machinery and these grounding zones where arcane machinery interconnects cause a periodic disruption to spells from the influx of chaotic arcane energy. Magic spells cast in this area suffer a -2 to effective spell level and -4 in severe grounding areas. Also everything in the area is subject to a greater dispel every turn when in regular areas and every round in severe grounding areas.

**Extreme pressure -- **In these areas a singularity has recently formed increasing the pressure toward the center of the area however it has not yet been there long enough to accumulate or form voidstone. In these areas the pressure though high is fairly erratic and causes 1d6 bludgeoning damage per round.

**Hurricane force winds -- **This area has an erratic motile force to due to deformation and wear of the space within and the resulting wind is much higher than the rest of the eye. This results in anything in the area being blown 1d3 units in a random direction.

**Crystal Deposits -- **The pressures and chaotic forces that form the deeper parts of the eye occasionally form crystals of various types from the materials there. If the crystals are from a shattered geode and but a cloud of shards all unprotected objects or creatures traveling through the area take 1d4 slashing damage for every 5 feet passed through the sector above a speed of 30. At a speed of 60 and above the damage increases to 1d8 and also counts as piercing damage.

**Voidstone Field -- **This area has a singularity of folded space at its center which increases gravity in the immediate vicinity to very high levels. Unprotected objects or creatures that pass through this area take 5 points of pressure damage per round spent in the area. The various sized solid rocks of voidstone at the center of the field if touched cause a roll vs fortitude save DC 30 or be annihilated and cannot be resurrected except by wish or true resurrection. All voidstone within 30\' moves 5\' closer to any intelligent being nearest to it per round.

**Crypt -- **Crypts are filled with bonehoards and mausoleums that contain vast quantities of undead skeletons produced in the ethereal cathedrals.

**Linked Crypts -- **At times the crypts intersect and join together though not always in convenient grids. The crypts for one reason or another are locked to each other and the shades of the cathedrals usually create bridges of whatever material has sealed them together.

**Dark Mire -- **This is a folded extradimensional space that breeds various undead ethereal entities from the negative energy of the plane. As they are all connected to an ethereal temple within the city the intelligent among them can come and go but there are usually wraith, shadows, and occasional dread wraiths within mire at all times.

**Ethereal Cathedral -- **This is a much larger example of a crypt and can span multiple square miles of extradimensional space. It also harbors portal access to losthome and is the primary starting point of the wraith that patrol there. Deep in the heart of the cathedral is a shade in service to Darkavien that forges skeletons, golems, and other undead for use in an ever-expanding army. Connected crypts are built here from shadowstuff then released into the void.

### The City

****Size: Finite**** -- This area though it grows over time is a circular city 15km in diameter within a ring 30km in diameter plus 100 meters until the first barrier field into the eye The city itself is 2km thick

****Gravity: Objective Directional Gravity**** -- in this location gravity is straight down relative to an imaginary plane halfway deep into the city\'s thickness. Within 20\' of the border between sides there is no gravity.

### The Core

**Gravity: Objective directional gravity **-- In this area \'down\' is frequently related to which way the lights are oriented as the corridors and paths maintain their own down direction.

**Morphic traits: Static -- **This area is difficult to alter and if not an agent of the controlling entity an item dropped and ignored for more than 5 rounds becomes static as if it were a part of the plane until successfully moved.

Losthome 
---------

AKA: The place beyond the world

This area is used by the entity known as machine to house the lost it is not currently employing. As such it largely functions as a long-term memory. As the lost are not restrained here in any active fashion they often roam and create what little memories they still have access to when not oppressed.

**Gravity: Objective directional gravity** -- This area has a \'down\' though it is not always uniform. Cubes with down toward the faces are entirely possible in this area.

**Morphic traits: Magically morphic** -- All spells or effects that physically alter objects or the environment have a duration of permanent within their range. Effects that are already permanent operate as if under the widen and maximize metamagic feats.

**Size: Coterminous with all areas of the plane** - This plane is twice as dense as the normal plane so distance traveled in Losthome is halved relative to the normal plane.

**Truthless:** Food here is not nutritive and if an external food source is not available visitors may starve to death. Food may be made edible if a purify food and drink is cast on it first.

**Anchored:** Any object found on the plane cannot be removed from it without a concentration check per object to make each object real. Otherwise upon entering any other plane the material decomposes into a blue ichor that evaporates in 1d6 turns. This check cannot be done after the item has begun decomposing.

**Hypersensitive:** Even those that do not have training in magic can affect the environment in this place by mere visualization. Concentration checks by trained characters can be made to alter the environment according to the following table though characters may not take 10 or 20 on this check.
