### Spell-like abilities:

at will: Detect animals or plants, 2/day:Locate object; 3/day: chill touch

### Blindsense (Su):

Hairworms have a sense developed through exposure to the storm in needing to be able to discern constructs among the din of energy, mass, and sound. This sense is blocked by transparent substances of any thickness such as water or glass, the *protect from chaos* spell, and *magic circle against chaos* spells but otherwise works as blindsense.

### **Fly (Su):** 

Hairworms can levitate under their own power, reverse course instantly, or use their reform ability to emit their front from any side as to go another direction.

### Reform (Su)

Hairworms are made up of hundreds or billions of individual subunits functioning as a whole. These subunits can easily detach and reform into sub-creatures or to repair dismemberment as a standard action but must remain within 10\' of the whole. A hairworm can drop its size category by one when detaching until fine to produce four separate hairworms of that lower size category. Hairworms can also merge again provided they originated from a division of the same being. Units from different beings that attempt to merge can do so but after 1d4 months per size category above fine will divide equally their total volume into four times as many hairworms as formed the whole and one size category lower. For example four medium hairworms distinct from each other that merge will produce 16 small hairworms distinct from each other. Larger Hairworms that attack smaller ones will gain a size category in 1d6+4 days if they reform from four disabled hairworms their own size.
