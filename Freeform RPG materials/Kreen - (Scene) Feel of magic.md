Kreen\'s necropolis descriptions
================================

Entering the necropolis
-----------------------

### Warriors / Soldiers

Once outside the blinding empty whiteness of the conjugate gate your eyes begin to readjust to a rose and sandy light. First only the large balls of light on massive spires are visible in the distance. A moment more and a city forged from dark gray sandstone and wrought iron comes into view. The buildings themselves look overwrought for their apparent mundane purposes though as a result appear as much sturdy as well fortified. Iron bars protect stained glass windows in each of the buildings though most are either large cubes or small squat buildings with smoke stacks with their function indeterminate. The air whipping past stone walls is noisy and stifling not only from its dryness but from something intangible suffusing the air. In the distance a writhing storm where the fell wind blows from is seen full of blue specks as a possible source but other than an occasional gust of wind it is clearly held back from full force. Green vines with a hard coating like mother of pearl coat nearly everything in a thick canopy as if beckoning all to shelter though here at the gate they seem reluctant to pass as many vines simply make a hard turn or stop.

Here in the sand-blasted murk, magic can still be sensed patiently waiting. Not from life does it arise; the green vine seeming to boil across rooftops lies curiously silent. This chanting power lurking here is different in its order from centuries of nethril research. Gone is the impartial but fair strength of life to shore up one\'s own. Ticking, or at least a quiet pulsing, is persistant at the back of a mage\'s mind. Regular, unrelenting, unfeeling energy lurks instead to mind\'s reach. The touch of an adept\'s soul reveals it a metallic power of order that measures one\'s will,evaluates its means, then responds as it must. This quiet thread of execution awaits practitioners of the Art at arm\'s reach just as any would wait for others to bring it upon themselves.

### Divine

A warm constant light. The reassuring presence of a patron. Neither of these things followed you here to this reaching dark leaving its petitioner very much alone. Even prayers on the tongue seem as a spoonful of cinnamon. Hot as much as dry leaving one\'s throat to choke up the words. What God is still here, or at least the presence of one, is cold and unfeeling. Its awareness is dark and methodical though it feels neither malevolent or benevolent. In fact this presence of unwavering thought barely acknowledges the prayer at all only instead shrugging malicious and beneficent ones aside as one would a fly.
