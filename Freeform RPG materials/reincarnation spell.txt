Of those nature sees fit to wrack,
one rarely ever sees it give back.
Should choice be disturbing of order,
petition be posed at nature's warder.

Be it known that nature choose to create,
favored not to rebuild but to procreate.
Those taken to death truly needing return,
choice in vessel be only nature's concern.
