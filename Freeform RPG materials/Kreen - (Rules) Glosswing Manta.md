Description
-----------

The central central body of this manta is covered in runic patterns that fan out from the top above the brain meeting on the same spot at the underside. Only the central body and tail is the flat gray of its parent species with the luminescent blue highlights of runic writing as the remainder of its thick wing span resembles a gossamer butterfly wing seen in solid colors of either red, blue, or green. Colors tend to congregate with each other but the groups exhibit no outward sign of territorial nature.

### Behavior

A native to the normally life-hostile environment possibly arriving with a gate to some ocean Kreen used to gather water. These mantas used to live within the reservoir that feeds Vilyan\'s gardens and many still do. They have over time acquired a resistance to the outside environment and now thrive in both places. Though swimming normally in water when exposed to air the animals curl up and around surfaces as if swimming with some unseen current along them. Habitually placid toward animals or even planar travelers their diet consists entirely of the hairworm larvae that live in the greenish undulating sand around its extents. The sand provides little resistance as perhaps would a normal sand dune and the mantas freely swim inside the sand seeking prey to breach the surface in order to breathe.

### Combat

They have a passing intellect that is simplistic but rather bland. Obsessed with food and swimming they occasionally meet things in Kreen that attempt to restrict their passage. Though the skittish animals meet these threats with full retreat they use their illusory swarm abilities to harry pursuers while they make their escape. A sense of their intended prey helps them to feed though the mantas nevertheless flee inland to darkened cover if they detect a deep worm approaching the necropolis. Often the mantas have places scouted for such use though Kreen keeps them from appropriating too many buildings.

Abilities
---------

### **Illusory swarm (sp):** 

Though selfish the manta is a plant eater and does not like to interact with beings other than its food. The manta ray can induce a swarm of tiny copies of itself to emerge from under its wings that can exist up to 100ft from the manta. The swarm comprised of 3d10+20 individuals. Each image has 1 hit point and will swarm around a target or targets until the manta flees the range of the ability.

### **Spell Absorbtion (su):**  

Whenever a spell fails to penetrate a spellwarped's spell resistance, the creature gains one of the following benefits, chosen at the time that the spell effect is resolved.

-   **Might:** The spellwarped gains a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength for 1 minute.
-   **Agility:** The spellwarped gains a +4 enhancement bonus to Dexterity for 1 minute.
-   **Endurance:** The spellwarped gains a +4 enhancement bonus to Constitution for 1 minute.
-   **Life:** The spellwarped gains temporary hit points equal to 5 × the level of the failed spell.
-   **Speed:** The spellwarped\'s base speed increases by a number of feet equal to 5 × the level of the failed spell.
-   **Resistance:** The spellwarped gains resistance 10 to one energy type (acid, cold, electricity, ﬁre, sonic, or negative energy).

### **Levitate (su):** 

The glosswing manta glides over surfaces regardless of what their orientation may be as if swimming over it within a depth of 1\' from the surface. The manta can breach the \'surface\' of that range and will glide back down toward the nearest flat surface.
