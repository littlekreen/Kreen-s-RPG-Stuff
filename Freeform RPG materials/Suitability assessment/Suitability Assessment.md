    2.  Resources

        1.  It is observed that the Red Wizards have a efficient production and materials base from which to build their power

            1.  Unwilled subordinates are acquired by water providing easy mass labor resources
            2.  Some mine resources have been exhausted but various mountain locations provide ample resources
            3.  Mass manufacture of magic items by Thay has produced vast quantities of labs for easily accessible materials manufacture

        2.  There is a large proportion of wizards in the population.

            1.  This increases the amount of magic items being exported
            2.  Vast quantities of subordinates are available to construct needed larger items
            3.  Thay would be able to implement various mythals that would facilitate a power base of further efficiency

        3.  Armies are well organized and battle tested

            1.  Division of battle mages is feared and well trained
            2.  Foot soldiers are mostly undead
            3.  Living troops are mostly shock troops and reused upon death.

        4.  Power and governmental structure precludes ineptness in living servants.

            1.  Gross ineptitude is punishable by death.

                -   Szazz Tam is very diligent in observing underlings suspected of incompetence
                -   Fiefdoms are not tolerated, attempts are met with force.
                -   Overindulgence leading to inattentiveness to duty is met with punishment

            2.  Duty assignment is made in a highly regimented fashion

                -   Roles are clearly defined
                -   Political struggles are tolerated but dealt with quickly if disruptive.
                -   Failures due to political endeavor is not tolerated.

            3.  Power structure is solid

                -   Information is well maintained
                -   Improvements to failures are unarguable
                -   Continuous improvement is expected within defined areas under the target\'s control.

    3.  Weapons

        1.  Thay has extensive use of magic troops and undead

            1.  Easily manufactured low quality
            2.  Summoned extra planar beings are often rare and high power for use on point as formation breach.
            3.  Constructs are used as well and are often breach devices.

        2.  Magic items are prolific and enable heavy protection of otherwise fragile undead

            1.  Conventional armor types are often used for undead. This uses little resources but provides minimal protection. Deadwraps are much more resilient and allow for high agility maneuvers.
            2.  Magic items used by troops are often bound to the individual to inhibit use by enemies.
            3.  Tattoo magic is sometimes employed by ground troops increasing their usefulness in comparison

        3.  High magic weapons are unheard of.

            1.  It is likely they do not possess the information for ritual applications of such.
            2.  For purposes of general use high magic weaponry is considered above 9<sup>th</sup> circle.
            3.  Modern convention of high magic weapons are used as wands of the 6<sup>th</sup> through 9<sup>th</sup> circle.

            3.  There are rumors in the black market that materials for dracoskeletons have been procured.

        2.  Living

            1.  Foot bound soldiers
            2.  Dragon Rider battlemages.

        2.  Endless self-destructive habits contrary to the gain of the whole but responsive to order through force
        3.  Little patience. Various groups within the wizards of thay have been making clear and overt efforts to dominate. This is not suited to my needs.

    7.  Suitability

        1.  Sazz Tam may prove worthwhile in the short term as sphere bearer.
        2.  It would not be prudent to give information to Szazz Tam that may fall into the hands of the opposition upon death.
        3.  Szazz Tam may intake information and make a failed attempt to destroy me. The sphere bearer would need to be destroyed and that would bring unwanted attention.

        4.  It is possible to obtain access to bodies and other materials illegal to access by other power bases

            1.  Guild has several dedicated groups to exploring ruins for artifacts to sell on the black market.
            2.  Various crypts have been accessed to facilitate the dumping of bodies.

    5.  Longevity

        1.  All leaders are transient humans.
        2.  Leaders are assassinated on a regular basis as they age, this provides a fairly consistent leadership of the same personality
        3.  Any wide exposure generally results in the destruction of the local guild by local authorities. This makes my capture an unwanted possibility.

    6.  Behavior

        1.  Extreme behavior favoring individual effort, this is not conducive to fortified positions
        2.  Generally driven by greed for trinkets of little inherent worth.

        4.  Well suited to current task of acquiring black market resources and clandestine acquisition of regular resources or personnel.
        5.  The ghost will need to be unaware of the bonding to facilitate the acquiring of a sphere bearer which the ghost would be otherwise make difficult.

            2.  Current leader\'s dedication to the whole seems to waver but nonetheless seems intelligent.
            3.  Are amenable to providing privacy without actually doing so though this may be due to my foreign nature and what else is in my proximity.

        3.  Habits precluding amenable contact with humans

            1.  Seem to be generally aligned as a whole
            2.  Humans and fey find each other distasteful for little current reason. This nonetheless prevents wide distribution of overt activities.
            3.  Fey can interbreed with humans making fey with little incentive to remain with the whole of either side but allowing spies in both directions.

    3.  Weapons

        1.  physical weaponry is unknown
        2.  Magic weaponry is proficient but also generally unknown.
        3.  All fey seem to have at least a minimal proficiency in magic endeavors.

    7.  Suitability

        1.  It is unknown if their knowledge can significantly add to my own and further efficiency.
        2.  Unconfirmed rumors of undead creatures built by fey. Seem to be a rare occurrence. This may be due to unwanted restraint in the application of force.
        3.  Low breeding rate, may be unsuitable due to extinction. Blue magic could resolve this issue but I deem this a waste of knowledge and effort to counter.
        4.  Determined to have no innate preference against infliction of mass destruction of land in pursuit of power. This is concurrent with my needs.
        5.  Life preference may simply be cultural cover. Further investigation is prudent.

5.  Clan MacBeathenne

    1.  Location

        1.  Planar fabric is motile in this area. This may simply be do to foreign mechanics or heavy energy use on the plane producing interference. Coordinates are approximate.

    2.  Resources

        1.  Alchemical knowledge

            1.  Mechanics of unknown type are extremely desirable.
            2.  High alchemy resulting in mass destruction weaponry.
            3.  Some of the observed alchemical products appear to integrate some magical methods. It may be easily integrated into my existing knowledge.

        2.  Drive for the persecution of sentient races.

            1.  Persecution of fey may allow for little care for the acquiring of fey bodies for reanimation. It is unknown if they will be suitable for this purpose however
            2.  Leaders also exhibit this behavior making it possible to manipulate in my favor should the need arise.
            3.  Current leader is deemed perceptive and may prove resistant to habits not conducive to the efficient of the whole while the whole remains manipulatable.

        3.  Observed religious fervor

            1.  The ghost was burnt by local clerics demonstrating a use or knowledge of turning.
            2.  No diefic influence was observed, this may allow for the faith to be preempted by other means.
            3.  Religious fervor leading to hostile action may be simply a limited sample. It is prudent to investigate further.
            4.  Druid group may prove resistant to usurping of unattended religions.

    3.  Weapons

    4.  Troops

        1.  Unknown. Manor troops well armed and trained.
        2.  All carry weaponry determined to be high-energy. It is likely that minimal skill is required to operate weaponry at a base level.
        3.  Troops wear nonmetallic armor of unknown quality. Assumed to be superior to current nonmetallic nonmagical armors. Investigation is prudent.

    5.  Longevity

        1.  Rulership is hereditary. This should provide a stable base of operations in as much humans can be such.
        2.  Reputed to not have impulsive violent behavior and this should minimize uprisings by populous

            1.  Though this assessment is circumspect given previous war it is likely true for common activities.
            2.  Populous habits are unknown but clan behavior is evident.
            3.  Racially motivated behavior is evident toward fey that should reduce their threat level as a whole.

        3.  The ghost is currently constructing a conjugate gate using gained resources.
        4.  Modifications have been made to the conjugate gate design that should minimize potential threat to a base of operations.

    6.  Behavior

        1.  1.  Local developing religion deemed hostile.

                -   The ghost was attacked by priests
                -   Resources have been gained as a byproduct of the local religion and local authority.
                -   Threat level of religion is determined to be insignificant.
                -   No appreciable presence of a deity has as yet been detected.

            2.  Societal relations appear important. This may allow for ease of mass manipulation of a populous that can be indoctrinated to obey and not ask questions.

                -   Familial ties are strong
                -   The ghost has been adopted by ruling clan, this is suitable to my needs.
                -   Adoption has proven to exhibit genuine behavior toward the ghost. Also suitable to my needs.

            3.  Most dedicated to combat appear to still be in a state of high alert. This may be due to existing threat from fey populous.

    7.  Suitability

        1.  Determined likely to have no innate preference against infliction of death and mass destruction of land in pursuit of power. This is concurrent with my needs.
        2.  Preference to life-based endeavors may simply be cultural cover. Further investigation is not needed at this time, assumed to be normal human habits.
        3.  The nature of devices and methods in use by the society is both foreign to my knowledge and common to my workings. I consider this an investigation of great priority.
        4.  Tightly knit behavior by the clan will provide excellent support. The ghost\'s methods of obtaining reagents may be useful instead of direct methods.
        5.  Exceedingly large population of humans on the planet for use in the sphere bearer\'s interests.
        6.  There may be a pending war with the diminished fey that would provide this knowledge as well as fey knowledge. They are unlikely to win given their limited numbers.
        7.  I have taken measures to ensure that the conjugate gate in planning diminishes the efficiency of fey mass destruction spells. This also protects my resources in the state manor.
        8.  Troops are regimented but relatively voluntary but numbers of the soldiers appear to be stable despite this. This increases the competence of the army in its enthusiasm.
