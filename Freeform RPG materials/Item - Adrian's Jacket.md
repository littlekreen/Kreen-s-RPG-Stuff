Adrian\'s jacket
================

**Source memory:** The death of Kreen

**Original Trauma:** Slow bleeding death of the construct

**Descriptor:** Slightly bluer than the original color it occasionally drips refined mana that doesn\'t seem to stain or even stick to its wearer. The coat will only work for Adrian and any damage to the coat will be repaired at a rate of 1 HP/2 rounds. Any surface injuries sustained by the wearer are subject to the jacket\'s repair rate though its own damage is repaired first. As long as the coat is not damaged the wearer will automatically stabilize from contact healing though will not be repaired of internal injuries and may still risk death depending on the damage received.

**Armor: **DR 5/Holy otherwise as armored coat, see pathfinder SRD

Powers: 
--------

**Utility (Sp)** -- The coat can produce any non-magical item in its pockets under 1GP in value that the wearer has ever possessed while wearing the coat once per round. This ability is activated by the coat\'s programming which appears to exhibit an often poor or incomplete understanding of the task at hand in its selection of \'useful\' items. Though the jacket can produce edibles or potions they are tasteless (except for a faint hint of cheese) as the consumables have no nutritive value or any magical effects. Consumables with non-magical effects retain their abilities such as a bottle of aspirin. Discarded items vanish within a day after leaving the wearer\'s possession so while it can produce money spending such gains is inadvisable.

**To Grips (Su) --** The wearer\'s hands will take on a four fingered insectoid form when the jacket is worn. It feels from inside like one is wearing skin-tight gloves attached to the sleeves. If the wearer has more fingers than the hands, namely three fingers and a thumb, the remaining unused fingers will become numb. The hand exhibits a construct\'s properties in that heat or cold will not induce pain or injury unless the damage would pierce its damage reduction as well as a great deal of abrasive tolerance. Its sense of touch is muted but no more than ones hands would if actually wearing such thin gloves. If dismembered the jacket\'s arms will vaporize and reform the over the next turn but the actual limb inside the jacket will only be temporarily numb. Though this effect does nothing for senses originating from the hands themselves as when they are damaged the wearer will still feel their injury.
