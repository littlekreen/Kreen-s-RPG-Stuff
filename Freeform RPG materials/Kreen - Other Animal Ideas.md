### Description

These creatures were originally crustaceans from the reservoir but have since employed their natural absorption abilities as well as their carbon fiber nacre carapace to escape through Kreen\'s filtering system into the outside. Very small creatures they will attach to whatever hard surface is nearby and can be found coating large areas in small pointed caps segmented into eight triangular pieces. When unperturbed the barnacles push their caps outward to reveal an anemone-like center that filters material from the air.

#### Behavior

These creatures are timid and do not instigate violence. They are more likely to either bunker down by closing their shell shut or evacuating the area. They move by rapidly pulsing their small octogonal plated bodies to flap their way through the air. A swarm tends to congregate with others of its type and communicates through tremors by drumming on a surface with the tentacles they use to adhere to it. They reproduce via eggs left behind on organic material though will protect the egg until the offspring is suitable for the environment. Offspring look similar to the parent but are transparent and have teeth they eat organic material with until maturing.

#### Combat

If pressed these creatures will swarm in the air and begin using the edges of their shells to slam into a creature leaving small ragged slices all over the skin. If they do manage to put down the creature they will settle down on it to protect their new food source from external consumption.

### Abilities

#### Adhere (Ex):

The barnacles can adhere to any solid surface with eight small feet on the underside of their bodies. Should they make a grapple check to hold onto a living being they can adhere to the skin or fur and will only be removed by killing the barnacle or removing the surface. Barnacles dislike adhering to the inside of living things and will not suffocate creatures by covering them though if a swarm successfully grapples a target it will require a strength check DC 15 to take a move action and the target will be blind until clearing their eyes and ears of barnacles

#### Spell Absorption (su):

Whenever a spell fails to penetrate a spellwarped's spell resistance, the creature gains one of the following benefits, chosen at the time that the spell effect is resolved.

-   **Agility:** The spellwarped gains a +4 enhancement bonus to Dexterity for 1 minute.
-   **Endurance:** The spellwarped gains a +4 enhancement bonus to Constitution for 1 minute.
-   **Life:** The spellwarped gains temporary hit points equal to 5 × the level of the failed spell.
-   **Speed:** The spellwarped\'s base speed increases by a number of feet equal to 5 × the level of the failed spell.
-   **Resistance:** The spellwarped gains resistance 10 to one energy type (acid, cold, electricity, ﬁre, sonic, or negative energy).

-   High maximum reproduction rate strongly regulated by radioactivity
-   Radiation immune - Regardless of radiation level it will not destroy the lichen or its spores.
