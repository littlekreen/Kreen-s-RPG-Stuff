One am I with two sibling
Done with two ever quibbling
Straight my aim; sage my measure
State my preference pain or pleasure
In house of faculty I reside
Kin there for I: sin and pride

What are my siblings and I?

Cold our eyes metal our heart
Old since true calloused start
Woe from many well knowing death
Tho\' never shall we take one breath
Run our path and they I bind
One by chain; unwhole by mind.

Who am I?

Ans: Id/Super-Ego and Ego, Darkavien (kreen/vilyan) / Machine (Kreen/Lost)
