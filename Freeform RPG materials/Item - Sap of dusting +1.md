Description
-----------

As Artifact construct Kreen of Darkavien Starblade has had to deal with both violent bouts of anger, at the latter person displaced due to the former condition, as well as areas to dust measuring in square miles this particular item was forged in fit of inspiration to deal with both problems. A later version added \'command\' words to ignite the weapon\'s ability that consists of an adaptive list of intensely disgusting swear words in a litany of tongues that Kreen happens to speak. The item itself though not a true intelligent item is merely just clued in enough to recognize a swear word when the weapon hears them. Kreen has been known to send planar couriers with these unmarked objects to deserving targets with similar issues though for that reason they are almost never seen on the open market.

**Emphatic Dusting** (SP) -- The user must shout with something that sounds like swearing and the next strike will ignite this ability. Should the user be unable to speak the weapon also recognizes rude gestures if made with a hand that was wielding the weapon. Once activated the following spells happen simultaneously: one, a fireball discharges into the vicinity making head-wringing explosion that vaporizes dust (dust being piles usually composed of minute organic materials and silica); two, a power that insulates non-dust objects from the heat for the duration of the fireball as not to destroy things while dusting; and lastly, the sap inhibits the striking force so that while used to strike fragile things the weapon will not apply force to them any more than the fireball will and the wielder feels as if they had hit an immobile object. Repeated applications in areas with a great deal of sand may result in thin layers of glass.
