Description
-----------

These former locusts have been tainted by life inside the necropolis connected to the necromantic artifice named Kreen and struggle to exist as tightly knit sustainable hive groups instead of their hyper-consuming habits as seen in Faerun. In order to assist in their fight for survival there they have become strongly symbiotic to the Samhain vine that grows wild across the city. Some of the vein patterns on their wings have begun to reflect the flower patterns of their host as their species rapidly changes in response to the mutative effect of the ambient negative energy. The entire body of these insects are colored a neon red with wings of a graceful butterfly appearance to glide through erratic air currents common to Kreen. Social, fairly placid insects they flit around living beings or heat sources absorbing energy to survive. Where mandibles once were to feed themselves there are a form of spinnerets used to shovel carbon to use in making their protective hive or to weave carbon fiber. Areas were a swarm is nesting is generally covered in a thick layer of this fiber in various organic shapes intent on keeping the environment at bay.

### Behavior

Still the plague they were on the Faerun these vermin are made only slightly docile by an unmerciful environment. They consider living things a indirect food source occasionally defending them from undead empowered by Kreen. Simplicity of their intellect results in attempting to remove threats and occasionally not realizing that they have killed everything by sheer numbers. This habit of indiscriminate threat response has garnered the honor of alpha predator and the Samhain vine a ubiquitous defensive presence inside of Kreen. In lieu of anything willing or able to eat the insects population is controlled by sheer mortality rate of progeny from necromantic effects. If encountered singly they can be flighty but will not harm energy sources unless harmed first. Females among their number spend all their time laying eggs in successful hives then discarding the many eggs that perish. Males instead gather energy or food sources so that the females may lay more eggs. The hive itself converses with a primitive form of common composed of insect noises.

### Combat

Red hoppers\' intense dichotomy to their behavior owes to their heritage. Once Perturbed or outright threatened they respond en-masse to smother the threat with their abilities. The species exhibits no territoriality and members freely move among the hives. Threats that prove hostile may find themselves walled into buildings or encased in carbon fiber. Lacking in a physical bite their larger front legs are used to stab a threat to drive it away or repeatedly using its energy drain attack to siphon everything from the target that they can. Though without a sense of mortality they have a rudimentary intellect that helps directly protect them from the environment and they will scatter to gather more members if badly outmatched. If the Samhain vine calls every swarm within hearing range will arrive with maximum hostility in mind. Everything that moves too quickly or acts violently is likely to be smothered if not outright suffocated by being encased in carbon fiber.

Abilities
---------

### **Exude (Ex):** 

The red hoppers can eat any ash or carbon source to exude it onto surfaces as small strips they weave together in fused walls. As front mandibles have been replaced with a form of spinnerets for this purpose they can no longer bite or even consume organic food so dead beings are of no interest to them. Individuals do not make very large of a deposit at any one time but an entire swarm builds its hive in dark locations in the vicinity or on top of one of the Samhain vine roots. Woven material has a hardness of 12 and 25 HP per inch of thickness. Should the swarm attempt to encase victims they must each make a strength check DC 10 plus 2 per encasing swarm or be physically affixed to the earth. Every subsequent round the difficulty will increase by 2 until either a target frees themselves or they fail by more than 10. Once a subject fails by more than 10 they have been sealed together though they may still make checks to break the encasement they must make suffocation checks every subsequent round. A swarm can encase any individuals occupying its space at any one time. Should a swarm choose to wall in an area against aggressive intruders or to produce hives swarms can create .1 inch of thickness over an area per swarm per two rounds over any one side of 5 ft square provided they have an ash or carbon source within 30 feet.

### Absorb Energy (Sp):

As enervores the red hoppers feed on the life energy of living things or failing that, heat sources. Samhain vine nodes produce enough heat to sustain a swarm\'s eggs though the parents gather energy elsewhere to avoid starving their progeny. Often the eggs will be left unattended in the black reinforced shell encasing a Samhain vine root if energy is scarce (which it usually is). This ability can be used as touch attack causes 3d6 points of negative energy damage that feeds the swarm for 24 hours. Alternately the swarm can spend an hour siphoning heat from anything above air temperature to either keep themselves fed for thrice that time or gain 1 HP. When removing heat from living things the swarm induces 1d6 points of cold subdual damage every turn. They do not try to kill living things as individuals but the swarm can be unintentionally lethal. They can and will use both abilities to lethal effectiveness for hive defense or defense of the samhain vine then retreat to their docile habits. Save versus reflex for half DC 18. Other red hoppers are completely immune to this effect.

### Hallucinogen blood (Ex):

A compound in their bodies is a virulent drug. Should a target eat one and fail a fort save DC 17 they will suffer the primary effect of insanity for 1d3 days with the secondary effect of 2d6 temporary Wisdom damage. This compound, when refined, is sold by the Thieves of Amn as a drug by the street name of "Ilmater\'s Penance" though it is unclear how they obtain a supply of the insects. Immediately addictive this forces the subject to relive the parts of their lives that inspire feelings of guilt or remorse merged with their current reality. To those devoid of morality it inspires a deep sadness instead of insanity.

### **Spell Absorption (su):**  

Whenever a spell fails to penetrate a spellwarped's spell resistance, the creature gains one of the following benefits, chosen at the time that the spell effect is resolved.

-   **Might:** The spellwarped gains a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength for 1 minute.
-   **Agility:** The spellwarped gains a +4 enhancement bonus to Dexterity for 1 minute.
-   **Endurance:** The spellwarped gains a +4 enhancement bonus to Constitution for 1 minute.
-   **Life:** The spellwarped gains temporary hit points equal to 5 × the level of the failed spell.
-   **Speed:** The spellwarped\'s base speed increases by a number of feet equal to 5 × the level of the failed spell.
-   **Resistance:** The spellwarped gains resistance 10 to one energy type (acid, cold, electricity, ﬁre, sonic, or negative energy).
