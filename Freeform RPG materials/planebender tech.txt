Celebrindal's limit (Angrod Celebrindal) - Theory of demiplane mechanics discovered during experiments in high elven magic by Angrod Celebrindal, a half-elven artificer residing in an unknown nethril floating city.

Celebrindals experiment parchments: "Tetra" Section 14 Day 35 - "In our experiments in improved gate mechanics a delaying accident has provided us with a unique opportunity for knowledge. Our observations and hypothesis is as thus: Only so many seconds of time can pass in the spherical natural angle relative to the flow of time in the main conjugate gate and have the local extra-subplanar stack yet remain stable. Experimental results put this limit at the total percentage of flux buffer allowed to a given stable extra-subplanar stack system while further limited by the amount of surplus raw capacity in the foreign conjugate gate and the maximal mana intake before environmental corrosion. Exceeding this inherent tolerance will cause the excess energy to normalize like dense foam merging to coarse bubbles. This proved excessively detrimental to our equipment transiting as well as the volunteers. Matter among the merged horizons will be displaced in favor of the most dense per unit absolute space (central conjugate relative) due to ideal efficiency of energy. This generally favors constructs over volunteers so we will ensure the constructs have alterations to ensure the prisoners are harmlessly displaced to the outside of our equipment in any recurrence. Thankfully I have assistants to clean up the mess."
