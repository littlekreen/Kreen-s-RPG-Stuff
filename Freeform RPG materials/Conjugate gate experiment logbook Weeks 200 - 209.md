Celebrindal\'s Limit

1.  History

    1.  Origin is unknown

        1.  Most information indicates it was built outside the floating cities as the ambient fields would make research difficult

            1.  This may indicate that the facility was built near the edges of the Anauroch.

                1.  Despite its remoteness the facility was apparently built in a verdant valley
                2.  This limits the search to mountainous areas as most of the rest of the Anauroch was fairly flat.
                3.  There are more than a few tunnels carved into mountainsides all over the Anauroch, without more data it may be chasing ghosts to find the facility.

            2.  There are indications that the location was exceedingly isolated and they may not have been aware of Karsus until Mystral\'s death.

                1.  The death of Mystral and thus death of magic for a time is likely to have wreaked havoc on whatever is left of the facility
                2.  Many of the wards and artifice may have reconstituted themselves afterward and would still be useful for study
                3.  Should the facility be found and secured for study the information would likely fetch a king\'s ransom.

                    1.  The Zhentarium could pay a goodly sum but they are more likely to seize than to be honest about such a dealing
                    2.  The red wizards of Thay would be interested as well as stingy but Szazz Tam is likely to keep to his word in view of the Zhentarium\'s desire. Overpricing the location is not advised.
                    3.  Neverwinter or any of the capitol city-states in northeastern Faerun would pay handsomely if one can navigate the bureaucracy of the archmagi council.

        2.  If there was anything left after the fall of Karsus it is likely beneath the Anauroch

            1.  Celebrindal made notes of ensuring a sturdy research area so further logs may be inside the likely intact underground facility.

                1.  Whom or whatever Celebrindal answered to is unlikely to share

                    1.  The shades may be looking to recover the information

                        1.  There have been encounters of them by mercenary companies patrolling the black road
                        2.  Several library thefts have been attributed to the shades for books that may be related to the project
                        3.  My contacts in Amn indicate that several cartographers have been contracted for the region.

                    2.  It may not necessarily be a city-state they were working for

                        1.  The city-state was apparently aware but they were actively avoiding major interest
                        2.  It is unclear if they were operating under the city-state\'s knowledge of their activities
                        3.  Most of the equipment was manufactured on-site when it is likely the any of the city-states would have been more expedient.

                    3.  The presence of a contractual demon for security may indicate a contract among the planes.

                        1.  Nineclaw was a lower demon, no mention is made of his history in a general sense
                        2.  Summoned by someone other than Celebrindal as she was not a demonologist
                        3.  Had a binding to Celebrindal as well as to her assistant.

                2.  The external walls were hewn directly out of the mountain.

                    1.  Magically reinforced for structure

                        1.  Stronger than normal granite by immersion of worked iron in the stone
                        2.  Ethereal passing was inhibited by a later of lead glass on the inside of the structure.
                        3.  Though the elementals repair cracks in the outer granite some magically modified specie of deep spider maintains the lead glass on the inside of the facility.
                        4.  The top of the facility is layered in the same lead glass except for just above the endpoint gate
                        5.  The area above the endpoint gate also has the same spiders in the empty space but the glass on the inner later is not impregnated with lead.

                    2.  Maintained by earth elementals in trade for a earth plane gate.

                        1.  It is likely they are still maintaining the structure if the earth plane gate is active.
                        2.  The elementals were recorded as amenable to the deal though Celebrindal notes they were unhappy with the mining done by the dwarves.
                        3.  The dwarves later made peace with the elementals by promising to decorate their main tunnels ornately

                    3.  Water was provided by a reservoir on-site through an underground river.

                        1.  It may be the easiest ingress to the facility
                        2.  The security measures are unknown, it is unlikely Celebrindal would have forgotten it.
                        3.  The river is noted as disconnected from the underdark when the dwarf warehouse/mine walled it off for safety.
                        4.  Earthquakes since then may have flooded the facility by redirecting the underground river

            2.  These logs came from an outpost among one of the city states

                1.  It appears they were regularly sent along that route but it is unlikely any other than this one is along it.

                    1.  The patrols heading to the remote area were infrequent
                    2.  Caravans were almost explicitly on request from the facility
                    3.  The route was primarily along current routes through the Anauroch but the route taken to the facility for the last leg of the trip is unknown.

                2.  The city states are rumored by desert travelers to be traveled by the shades.

                    1.  The source of the rumors are fairly suspect but other evidence indicates that they are likely to be true.
                    2.  The shades have become increasingly active since report of their city becoming present on the plane
                    3.  Whatever power they wield it is sourced from the high mages of Netheril with centuries of time for nothing but study. Any hostile contact with them is unadvised.

                3.  The shade city may be interested in this artifice as it is unlikely the information was shared to the city-states as a whole

                    1.  Their motives are as unclear as their forms and it may behoove the circle of archmagi to risk investigation
                    2.  Should any one group acquire the artifice it may alter the balance of power
                    3.  The shades are likely ones to best implement any knowledge gained by its study while simultaneously the most inclined to use it as a weapon for their own gain

            3.  It is worth examining if a copy of these logs is inside the rubble of ruins remaining of the city states though that is fairly high risk.

                1.  Security measures in the lab were fairly strong and constructs were used in some of the secure area.

                    1.  Most magical traps may be inert but some could have survived.

                        1.  High powered mage wards if not intended to be lethal to start with will certainly be so after damage from the fall of Karsus.
                        2.  Power words and like circle magic are possible here. Take great care with exploration.
                        3.  Dispelling the traps may be possible, but it would be more likely that a temporary anti magic field would be necessary.

                    2.  Some mundane dead end traps were used toward the entrances of such facilities to catch most intruders as they were easily reset by subordinates and required no mage\'s attention.

                        1.  These are more than simple pit traps. Scythes false floors, hinged passageways, are all likely.
                        2.  Most likely have some sort of override for workers to use though it may be well-hidden or on the opposite side of the trap.
                        3.  Dead-end impasses are as common as false dead-end impasses. Navigation without some aid will likely take some time.

                    3.  Some living countermeasures were apparently inserted below the walled-in area so ingress from the lower section may be difficult.

                        1.  It is only mentioned by passing so the exact nature of the threat is unclear.
                        2.  It may be some sort of hostile underdark fungus, no mention of provisions is made.
                        3.  Alternately it may be a colony of some hostile creature that feeds on the underdark in that level.

                2.  The guard constructs\' pass phrases have long since been lost unless they are in an as of yet undiscovered logbook

                    1.  The guard golems are equally valuable, if they still operate, as machines made by Celebrindal.

                        1.  They can easily weigh enough to break a flimsy cargo cart so reliable transport will be a concern.
                        2.  Restraints on the golem will prove more difficult, it is advised to bring a mage for binding if not heavy manacles.
                        3.  Should the guard break free all information indicates it will head directly back to the facility rather than attack.

                    2.  If the golems are inactive the only part of interest would be the machine heart at the lower center of the torso.

                        1.  Removal should be by a mage with at least cursory skill in constructs as to avoid undue damage to the unit.
                        2.  The machine heart will need careful packing after removal from the frame\'s protective housing.
                        3.  These golems are reputed to be some sort of hybrid of elemental and machine, this may add complications to transport of the machine heart let alone its removal.

                    3.  Their weapons are expected to be mundane.

                        1.  Likely large bastard swords or long swords as was generally used in that era.
                        2.  Their hands are articulated and the golems are competent fighters.
                        3.  Expect heavy and skilled resistance if encountering them while searching for information

                3.  There is little in the way of flora and fauna in the Anauroch so it is unlikely that there is anything new in residence of the facility if found

                    1.  There are only a few likely candidates for residents if any at all

                        1.  Thri-kreen are noted to be present and expanding in the Anauroch. They hail from parts unknown but are intelligent and generally predatory though not openly hostile. Easily sated with food.
                        2.  Man-scorpions, very hostile culture, avoid contact if possible
                        3.  Spirit undead haunt a vast quantity of the Anauroch due to the life drain magics used by the Phaerimm and can be an exceedingly strong threat..
                        4.  Nomads roam the Anauroch though they can often be dealt with through diplomatic means.
                        5.  Given the only transits of the Anauroch tend to be high-value, there are occasionally bandits targeting movement on the black road. Easily confused for nomads.

                    2.  The shades are likely to notice any incursion to the Anauroch and any sorties must be done quickly as to escape their attention.

                        1.  Many ill-advised ventures into shade territory have been made and thus far only a few have escaped with their lives.
                        2.  They seem to ignore any of the decoys that are sent through.
                        3.  They may have spies on several mage councils or dealings with the thieves of Amn. Probably both. Their information must come from one of these two sources given its sensitive nature.

                    3.  If any of the interested parties, of which there are many, get word of the expedition expect meddling if not outright threats to secure any results for themselves.

                        1.  At the top of this list is the shade city, though they will likely just observe to see if any success in pursuit of the facility is made.
                        2.  The Zhentarium would likely express interest in the information by open threats and display of force if any headway is made
                        3.  Most of the city states would express interest in a more nonthreatening fashion in possibly helping the foray in trade for first look at the results.
                        4.  Given the reticence of Mystra\'s chosen to provide any information it is likely they would interact with any such venture in some fashion.

    2.  Project to improve gates

        1.  Uses little energy at the end point in favor of powering a central point to connect all satellite gates

            1.  The central point requires a power source of immense proportion.

                1.  Only half of the total power available was used as a safety factor.

                    1.  A majority of the power was used by the last day so this may have just been for final testing
                    2.  Should this power still be contained it may prove to be inside volatile machinery that has aged.
                    3.  Containment was powered linearly from the stored energy as to fail softly should the machinery cease operate properly for some reason.

                2.  Even so the sheer power requirements deforested a few acres of the local environment with a moments surge in use.

                    1.  It is unclear as to the exact nature of the damage
                    2.  tons of "shattered charcoal" were checked in after the incident.
                    3.  Afterward the area was reforested though of course everything was later depopulated by the Phaerimm.

                3.  Safety release from containment breaches were mentioned in the construction of a new courser.

                    1.  This generally took the form of raw mana venting directly outside
                    2.  Though it is mentioned as being safely disposed of Celebrindal expresses concern with the potential for an undesirable increase in the chaos of magic in the area from the influence.
                    3.  A likely affect of this as far as modern theory is concerned posits that such regular releases may produce a wild magic zone from the randomness dumped into the area.

                4.  Explicit use of the quirk of sudden entropy loss was made to help regulate spikes in energy use though understanding of the behavior was incomplete.

                    1.  There was mention of a partial duplicate of several forest animals from the equipment when active
                    2.  It apparently duplicated the matter without its requisite spirit and the animals were inert even upon creation.
                    3.  Celebrindal notes that her assistant shows some inspiration with the activity by notes displeasure at the assistant refusing to inform her of his studies.

            2.  No mention of the specific artifice for power is mentioned; there are only descriptions by proxy or name

                1.  Kinderburn is the given code name for the power artifice

                    1.  This wasn\'t something that Celebrindal gave to the core
                    2.  It was originally referred to explicitly as the \'Endpoint planeisolative core\'
                    3.  Celebrindal\'s reports used the new name after a elven cat successfully had kittens in an active core.

                2.  The technology used for the core is mentioned as independent of the weave

                    1.  Little is provided in the way of information even in a cursory fashion
                    2.  Processes used during the production of the part that have little other function than to inhibit the weave further reinforce this
                    3.  It is mentioned that the finished product as a whole can tolerate and use the weave as a backup but the parts as individuals are intolerant

                3.  One attempt by a mage subordinate to dispose of broken material via disjunction resulted in no effect whatsoever.

                    1.  The machinery recreated its own patterns from some larger connection to the core
                    2.  It was noted there was a process to ensure the broken parts were disconnected before recycling
                    3.  The particular part noted as being disjoined also required a purification of the part before further treatment.

                4.  In one instance a faulty part melted away completely but somehow left a duplicate in some unrelated portion of the machine.

                    1.  The method by which this occurred is never explained
                    2.  "Spontaneous loss of entropy" is mentioned elsewhere in a theory of material and is related to "overload issues" within the core but the relation is not explicitly defined.
                    3.  The subordinates note that it is not yet possible to control the entropy loss without causing structural damage to the inner core envelope.

            3.  The initialization of the central gate is said to take several highly skilled portalists that handled circles beyond the standards of today\'s archmagi.

                1.  It is possible that some of Mystra\'s chosen know of related information.

                    1.  Only terse replies about promises made have been received by those I\'ve spoken to
                    2.  Other efforts to gain information from them have proven futile.

                2.  The only other source of information my be the Zhentarium as I have sources whom mention they are in search of some related artifact.

                    1.  What strikes me as disconcerting is that it was mentioned in the sense of something evading them

                        1.  The methods used contain an inordinate amount of force
                        2.  Despite the efforts used to contain the desired artifact it seems to spontaneously leave the plane with the Zhentarium then hunting for ghosts.

                    2.  Could this mean one of Celebrindal\'s constructs yet remains?

                        1.  I could not ascertain a description from the information as it would have alerted the Zhentarium to my presence.
                        2.  The constructs were said to be large iron golems but the Zhentarium did not appear to be chasing some huge monstrosity
                        3.  It apparently has been evading them for more than a generation without alerting the populace at large.

                    3.  It would be impossibly old though may be somehow persevered from the fall of Karsus from its uniqueness of the central artifice

        2.  Though the skills of portalists have improved greatly the total efficiency of this structure is immense in comparison

            1.  The total amount required to maintain an active gate link from current artifice almost a magnitude higher than what Celebrindal\'s conjugate gate manages as a whole in its static expenditure at an endpoint.
            2.  "Feedback incidents" are mentioned during construction that detonated several mages during construction

                1.  This still indicates high power levels in the core though the gate itself is extremely efficient.
                2.  These incidents resulted in the substance of the mages somehow melting away from itself. A cruel and painful death to be sure.
                3.  The effect suffered by mages on the incident at day 208 is noted to have been similar though more gruesome. An explanation is given that I leave to those more knowledgeable than I.

            3.  The materials used for forging though fairly exotic were not ideal compared to new metallurgy and a gate with modern equipment would be easier to produce since Mystra\'s limits on circles of power.

                1.  Steel core copper-clad metal was used for most of the machinery parts.
                2.  Some quartzite material imported from the main conjugate gate were used to build some of the foundation of the core sheath.
                3.  Gold core ceramic cabling was used for some process as yet unknown that distributed energy throughout the complex.
                4.  The rats apparently were an ingredient in the quartzite blocks but it is unclear as to why they would introduce the impurity
                5.  Crystals were mostly used for lighting but were also used in some of the control apparatus used for the gate.
                6.  The environment of the main conjugate gate was carved straight out of a granite mountain by dwarf miners.
                7.  Dwarves continued to mine iron from underground some distance away. They also report stabilizing a large cavern underneath the facility and walling off the underdark.

            4.  Portalist lore is missing several key theories to improve understanding of gate mechanics

                1.  these would likely be in the other journals that enable such high-efficiency use of power.
                2.  It is unclear how they performed their calculations so quickly but it is likely the purview of the core "Kinderburn"
                3.  The one provided in this journal is very beneficial but others are needed before the knowledge can be made useful.

        3.  The parts use an assortment of lower circle spells/mythals to reduce the power required to create them all at once

            1.  This compartmentalized spell casting makes it difficult to discern the actual purpose of the apparatus it is put into.

                1.  Several recovered components seem to go about their duties without respect to their disconnectedness from the whole.
                2.  The few recovered parts themselves only reveal nonsense to sages attempting to delve the dweomers about the pieces
                3.  Most of the recovered parts appear to self-repair and have nature auras about them.
                4.  Some of the parts have been deemed hazardous and how they were safely produced or handled is unclear.

            2.  Most of the parts were mechanical compared to the heavy crystal use of the day, and creation of them involved reagents

                1.  Reagents generally have too much entropy in the power they contribute to the spell and are thus considered unusable for those of higher circles.

                    1.  The parts themselves seem to thrive on chaos to a certain extent. A chaos mage from the the city of doors nearly suffocated after coming into direct contact.
                    2.  Celebrindal mentions that there was a way to improve the machinery to make it infinitely more adaptive to the but that she had come upon some roadblock.
                    3.  Mention of reagents that should never be used by a sane mage is made by Celebrindal and this may be in response to a suggestion by her apprentice the previous day.

                2.  Crystallography of spells has improved since then overall but Celebrindal seems to forgo it almost entirely

                    1.  Modern crystalline magics are more efficient but lack the complexity that came with the skill of Netheril mages.
                    2.  A few crystal-based spells are used but mostly for purposes unrelated to the conjugate gate such as lighting.
                    3.  The lighting itself is powered from the main sources and uses crystalline forms as there is a mention of the minimization of interference.

                3.  The knowledge of how to create mythallar is considered lost

                    1.  The few elves that know the procedure are not inclined to discuss it while they seem similarly unable to make more.
                    2.  The pieces of machinery that have been recovered from the mythallar seem to circumvent the reticence of the high elves in continuing to operate
                    3.  Should these items based on some lost technology crossed with mythallar and continue to operate it may be a way around the limit imposed by Mystra

            3.  It is unclear how the parts were created so purely using reagents as the \'forge works\' is only mentioned by proxy.
            4.  The parts themselves were generally enough for one person to carry, but the drive gears required constructs. The accurate forging of such large solid pieces of alchemical high elven artifice has quite obviously been lost as well.

        4.  A mention of a centralized intelligent construct at the core of the satellite gates is made, one has not been recovered

            1.  Its theorized purpose is to ensure unceasing adjustment of the subplane that would otherwise require the constant attention of a host of mages.

                1.  this alone would be an important discovery if the piece of the artifice was discovered.

                    1.  The only construct-type that comes close to this sort of expansive attention in mind are some psionic constructs observed in the control of higher Illithids.
                    2.  Gnomes on lantan have some sort of calculating machine not reliant on magical input but it is unlikely to be of any practical value. It is best to keep their potentially explosive things on lantan.
                    3.  The elves have a history of populating forests with sentient thought though this is not any surprise since this is from the same branch of magic.
                    4.  Dwarves have had one or two successes with sentient iron or stone constructs arising but this is likely due to diefic influence than dumb luck or technical advance.

                2.  The amount of control required to continually adjust a demiplane so that it remains intact is usually prohibitive on small spaces.

                    1.  Generally spells such as mordenkin\'s sanctuary provide a relatively limited time span on a small space. The spell is fairly efficient at is usage of energy and bleeds some from its users but the extra dimensional space becomes untenable after a prolonged period of time
                    2.  Unstable extra dimensional spaces can lose time or vent directly into the astral but as the space grows larger the amount of adjustments needed to hold it together expands exponentially.
                    3.  The core is noted to struggle only once to accommodate spell casting from 7 mages together in the subplane and the number of adjustments to handle this reliably in a temporary demiplane is immense.

                3.  Larger spaces have been made that self-adjust based on the activity of the spell but they have a maximum duration due to energy consumption

                    1.  These are mostly static demiplanes however. They are made once then never change their confines. This limits the amount of adjustments that need to be made from normal planar drift.
                    2.  Traditional demiplanes that have been observed consume a massive amount of energy to simply amplify planar inertia so the fabric does not tear itself apart and can handle spell casting easily.
                    3.  The central conjugate gate in theory could handle hundreds of demiplanes each with their own stack of coterminous planes. Known portalist lore would struggle to meet the demands to duplicate this.

            2.  No mention is made of their sentience, it is likely they are mundane constructs.

                1.  The core seems to not need any input from the main energy supply and is self-powering

                    1.  Most of the energy is consumed upon creation and thereafter the core extracts energy from the planar folds themselves.
                    2.  The main energy supply is explicitly mentioned as separate and insulated from direct passing through this area.

                        1.  A breach in one of the main sources had an interesting effect of creating effects visualized at that moment by those caught in the blast of raw mana while the core was simultaneously immersed in the cloud. This may be the reason for the insulation.
                        2.  The self-powering core does not seem to meet all energy needs as a recharge time between activations is mentioned.
                        3.  The incident on day 208 was during a period of extended use and the core was due afterward for an idle cycle this is mentioned as a possible cause for the destabilization.
                        4.  Direct contact with the core by an enterprising saboteur during an inactivity cycle resulted in his capacity for magic being vented into the core.
                        5.  The main core is highly hostile to any living things during activation and its power source seems to have extremely negative consequences while actively maintaining a conjugate link.

                2.  The core at site Nii-Hoason is given a call-sign and referred to as such

                    1.  It isn\'t used in any sense of addressing someone, but in the third person.
                    2.  It may simply be an anthropomorphism by the subordinate mages from familiarity

                        1.  Celebrindal never makes mention of the name directly and chastises one subordinate for continued use of the name
                        2.  Celebrindal\'s assistant forcibly removes the name from a subordinate\'s mind in an odd display of ferocity for Celebrindal.
                        3.  Given the inordinate amount of effort displayed to quash the name it may have some importance that is not readily apparent.

                    3.  The core\'s name was provided as "Kinderburn"

                        1.  ostensibly due to a kobold found dead in the core with sores and burns on his body.
                        2.  Celebrindal explicitly mentions that the sores were not from fire, but from the environment in the core during a test.
                        3.  The name is mentioned in local lore of a particular kobold tribe in the northern mountains as a stolen god but it is unclear if the two are related. Kobolds are not known for their historical accuracy.

                3.  direct evidence of thought or self-action is conspicuously absent

                    1.  Subordinates are reported to repeatedly address the core but no mention is made of any response
                    2.  An elven cat is noted to have successfully had kittens in the core room during an active cycle and had no ill effects. The method of her survival is as yet unknown as the cat was less than forthcoming. This nonetheless may indicate that some selection of action is going on outside of the confines of its defined purpose.

                4.  it is this researchers opinion that this strengthens the theory of a mundane core.

                    1.  A weakness observed in this theory is the activity observed in the local area that is as yet unexplained.
                    2.  Forest creatures were found observing wandering subordinates then returning to normal habits upon observation.

        5.  It is unclear where the other two sites were but the time indicated between shipment to the other gate makes it likely the satellite gates were not on Faerun.

            1.  An alchemical accident mentioned by proxy in one of the cities prevented shipments by conventional portal for a time.

                1.  During this time mentions of sailors are made indicating that the endpoint may be on another continent.
                2.  There are cursory charts presented of the navigational path but they appear to be incorrect with current maps of the distant location.
                3.  As yet no sailors have ventured into the area to confirm the land survey

            2.  There are mentions of construction on a foreign plane to avoid the city entirely but it was abandoned after some accident on day 208

                1.  The entry details an interesting observation about demiplane mechanics
                2.  It would take a massive quantity of energy to verify
                3.  The foreign facility may be largely untouched

    3.  Focus was on overall energy consumption of a multi-gate system

        1.  Needs of the Netheril empire changed as it grew larger resulting in a drive for advanced artifice

            1.  required larger scale equipment that did not rely so heavily on the weave.

                1.  Dimming in the weave in areas of high use was not unheard of.
                2.  Various methods of storing mana for use with heavily consuming artifice were developed
                3.  A consensus on higher-efficiency mana use was quickly arrived at and something that cannot be said for today\'s mages.

            2.  More and more equipment needed to be moved between distant points that land or portal transit found awkward or energy expensive.

                1.  Most of this is from building demiplanes for the various higher-echelon mages in Netheril.
                2.  The construction and equipment moving between planes is barely a sliver accounted for.
                3.  It is worth noting that If some or most of this equipment went to demiplanes then it may be floating aimlessly through the astral without a tether to their home plane.

            3.  Repeated and long-term activity of portals put severe strain on local space as well as the weave

                1.  A mention in a different text reported a rip in the planar fabric from a number of portals all initiated at once for a long period of time.
                2.  The effect of a failure in local space is not unlike attempting to cross two extra dimensional spaces within each other
                3.  Sometimes this attracted strange creatures from the astral or ethereal planes to cross over into the prime making it a security liability as well

        2.  Various points of existing portalist artifice at the time used brute force to solve certain problems

            1.  Locating the endpoint gate usually entailed a massive expenditure of energy so that the portal conduit latched on properly to its destination
            2.  Keeping the portal active while also stabilizing the transit of mana-using items is one concern

                1.  was and is usually solved by ensuring the system has enough power that the interference is drowned out.
                2.  Though the gate travel is instantaneous interference by magic items on a weak portal can be hazardous to those transiting.
                3.  The interference can go the opposite direction as well and the accidental destruction of magic items via induced chaos is possible without a careful balance between power and safety.

            3.  The portal entrances on both sites must resist the nature of the planar fabric to close the tear in space and existing mythallar or artifice were fairly incompetent in this regard.

                1.  Portals above a man\'s width tore themselves apart after a few hours without extra effort to stabilize local space

                    1.  Mutli-portal single conduits are a novel solution discovered for this issue.

                        1.  Created by a few portalists sometime in the recent thousand years
                        2.  but nowhere near ideal as the energy consumption is immensely larger than a single portal due to certain fixed consumption requirements
                        3.  The construction cost is similarly excessive as its energy use and few of theses gates exist.

                    2.  Though the destruction of a gate burning out is quite spectacular it is quite expensive and few large gates are made due to the risk involved.

                        1.  Generally the ones known are old and abandoned
                        2.  There are a few posited to exist in the possession of dragons to move hordes from plane to plane
                        3.  The process of burning out is largely dependent on what is moving through it. Lots of humanoids can take years to burn out. Large amounts of metals can reduce it to hours.

                    3.  The larger portals are very sensitive to magics used in their vicinity.

                        1.  Ones usually used to protect them from scrying can render a mind insane from incessant and repeated redirection
                        2.  Constructs can have their minds spontaneously blanked usually making them confused if not openly hostile
                        3.  Venting random pieces of particularly magically-active plane to any of the coterminous planes is also a concern
                        4.  These factors make larger gates generally undesirable from a standpoint of security.

                2.  Weak planes would need to be strengthened so that the portal did not rip out of local space.

                    1.  This usually involved planar anchors
                    2.  Strengthening the planes did work but meant that if a certain threshold was reached or the anchors were damaged severe consequences would occur for the area.
                    3.  The strength of a local space inside of a plane is difficult to gauge without breaking it first and then it is relatively useless for portals from its instability.

                3.  The energy required to maintain the conduit increased with the open duration of the portal

                    1.  Meta-planar motion stretches the conduit as both endpoints move in relation to each other.

                        1.  This effect more pronounced on some planes than others
                        2.  The chaos planes have a natural effect of distorting the portal conduit, as do local sources of chaos at either end.
                        3.  Artifices of magic generally cannot traverse portals well, and even then tend to carry their expected reality with them. Other side-effects are not uncommon.

                    2.  Mana use increases if the conduits wander too close to some planes

                        1.  The negative energy plane is notorious for removing portals that wander past it and venting travelers into it

                            1.  Given the consumptive nature of the elemental plane it is not surprising
                            2.  Even passing near the plane may be unhealthy. Growths and wasting diseases have been reported by adventurers using decrepit gates.
                            3.  Some older gates found and near the anarouch as well as near some abandoned elven kingdoms seem to have a loose connection to their endpoint and shift to random planes from time to time

                        2.  The shadow plane can occasionally transmute portions of passing gate conduits into shade stuff.

                            1.  This is usually an incomplete transmutation and lethal to most living things
                            2.  Beings made of shade stuff generally survive the gate incursion and may end up stronger for the trip
                            3.  The shadow plane generally connects to a vast majority of planes some theorized not to be in our local metaverse. This means that deformation of the planar conduit into this plane can be extreme if left unchecked.

                        3.  In general shielding or protections against planar incursion is a necessary function of gate entrances.

                            1.  These protections have obvious limitations on their adaptability in their static construction
                            2.  Any intelligent source endeavoring to disrupt a gate link can do so with relative ease given sufficient power.
                            3.  Protections are more effective if constructed specifically against particular incursion sources.

                        4.  Sometimes planes with very strong natural qualities can subvert the endpoint of a portal.

                            1.  generally spells account for this by closing the portal at one end and attempting the connection once more.
                            2.  The grey waste and some layers of the abyss can do this from time to time.
                            3.  Connecting gates to the outer realms of the great wheel is risky due to this effect.

                    3.  Control of the conduits is poor given the energies involved and Netheril mages apparently had little recourse as well.

                        1.  Current shielding methods closely resemble in function those used in artifacts recovered from millenniums past.
                        2.  Efficiency has improved slightly over time but the inherent improvement in nature of function has remained stagnant.
                        3.  Some progress is made by some portalist mages in the way of improving methods but few care to share with each other much less the libraries.
                        4.  What little progress is made in general knowledge is usually resulting directly from theft. Given Netheril\'s history this is likely to have little changed since the golden age of the floating city-states.

                4.  Portals could not easily be put into dense quarters without interference in the long-term.

                    1.  Sigil may be an exception here, the city of doors seems to have no issue with the reputed density of portals

                        1.  The lady of pain is oft given the reputation normally assigned to deities. It is unwise to argue and likely true besides.
                        2.  Information on her history is little and sparse for what can be found.
                        3.  Punishment for many she crosses paths with involves extra dimensional mazes created within the city of doors. This does indicate some deep knowledge of planar mechanics or deific level of control.

                    2.  There are a few other areas with abnormally high portal density

                        1.  They tend to have a presence of one sort or another that guards the area.
                        2.  Area presences may have a more direct purpose as yet undefined.
                        3.  The presences known in high density portal areas are either instinctual, sentient, or deific.
                        4.  Druids sometimes have similar areas of many portals but their power can be easily traced to one of many nature deities for reasons obvious.

    4.  Observed by the arch mages but kept secret from many.

        1.  The full history of the prototypes has been lost

            1.  Various documents and artifacts have been destroyed over the years

                1.  Assaults on various libraries and mage research labs have resulted in fires or outright destruction of materials.

            2.  Others have been stolen and only few found their way to the black market for recovery by magedom in some form.

                1.  This one journal was stolen from the recovering adventurers (who have since been laid low by fortuitous accident)
                2.  Another journal was found on auction in a nearby kingdom

                    1.  It was a careful forgery sold at the same time as the true copy much to the unfortunate finding of a brother sage.
                    2.  Surprisingly it contained more information than the original did, possibly a copy from a different source. The other source is yet to be found if it exists.
                    3.  The forger apparently had only transient access to the original document as half the book was obvious guesswork. This would indicate that the forger was not a primary source.

                3.  What little items can be found through the necessary evils of fences and thieves in regards to history are often difficult to authenticate

                    1.  Some more curious items that look similar to Netheril construction make their way into small cities of little note.

                        1.  What is surprising is that some of the more curious items that are very clearly of Netheril-style construction seem as if they were made within recent memory

                            1.  One of the objects had a modern stamp of dwarven steel makers but my contact was unable to purchase the item. It disappeared with older clerics shortly thereafter.
                            2.  A royal signet was spotted on one making it unmistakably modern-made. It found its way to the kingdom in question but none have seen it thereafter.
                            3.  Curiously some of these new but old items are found in the possession of children but they never seem to know where they got them. The children only know that it is found on their person at some point.
                            4.  They have become something of a collectors item among a few sages but there\'s a difficulty holding onto them for long.
                            5.  Collectors often have the items go missing and reenter at some point nearby in a similar auction from which they started.

                        2.  The items themselves defy attempts to authenticate them as either they have heavy resistance to scrying into their substance or they have little history whatsoever.

                            1.  The pure chaos in the items indicates a heavy knowledge of both planar mechanics, mundane construction, and raw magic.
                            2.  Whoever the builder of these items are they are not an amateur and forgeries can be easily detected by the absence of this strange sort of directed chaos
                            3.  When I managed to gain direct access to such an item my attempts discern its intended effects the confusingly direct answer from my deity was "Formerly unknown missing piece."

                        3.  When the agents of chosen are outed from time to time bidding can be fierce and the chosen have rarely lost.

                            1.  Where they are getting so much funding for completely unknown items is unclear
                            2.  They acquire foreknowledge of bidding of these items that cannot be mere happenstance
                            3.  With one items auctioned by the Thieves of Amn the guild took it upon itself to enforce the sale. The departure from normal procedure was quite the stir in some circles.
                            4.  There is some undercurrent of dealings and information that I am as yet unable to find a link to.

                        4.  Whether the thieves guilds steal them or are fencing them for persons not yet known is unclear.

                            1.  The only information I have managed to glean from a paladin of helm is that the thieves take them on consignment for a party unknown
                            2.  The item in question began to radiate quite a necromantic aura shortly after possession by the church
                            3.  After fading away the items on weak aura shone through indicating the constructor may be extremely skilled in necromancy.
                            4.  The clerics in the receiving temple received only visions of bronze gears as Helm seemed less than forthcoming about the item from my chats with them.
                            5.  My deity of knowledge saw it similarly fit to say little other than impress upon me to leave it be.

                    2.  Occasionally agents of chosen are found bidding on items

                        1.  They may be of an unknown interest to mystra or magic in general
                        2.  Both parties of thieves and chosen seem oddly happy to suffer each others presence long enough for the auction. It is strange to see paladins and wanted thieves coexist for a time.
                        3.  The prices go very high very quickly. One party for wanting it, the others for wanting it because others want it.
                        4.  Sometimes this is not found out until afterward when the item is handed to harpers or other such organizations.
                        5.  Some of the major counter-bidders of late are the Zhentarium and the red wizards of Thay. They hunt these items with a fervor that can only betray some importance.

                    3.  Thieves of some districts have orders regarding the items

                        1.  kill-on-sight orders in Amn for those trying to fence these items.

                            1.  It is uncommon to see a guild thief break into a building to return an item but reports of this by city guards have occurred in Amn with these items.
                            2.  Unsurprisingly there was a canceled red name by the local guild the same day but I was not able to find out exactly whom.
                            3.  Regular fences refuse to discuss the items let alone accept them for sale. They cite them as too hot for sale.

                        2.  the guild masters who have sold such items expressed that murderous behavior was strongly discouraged (possibly requested by the unknown craftsman) but thieves did not take it seriously until recently.
                        3.  Who orders this is an unknown and tightly held secret but they may be the same fencing these items with the thieves of Amn.

                            1.  Only a select few seem to know any real information and getting close to retrieve more may prove unhealthy
                            2.  The unknown craftsman may be a member of the thieves guild. The auctioneers only fence these high end items for members of high station.
                            3.  Inquisitors of some note for various parties come to me from time to time but know little more than I save for bits and pieces I stitch together.
                            4.  The auctions are handed down to the current guild master, possibly from generations further. The unknown craftsman may be quite old.

                        4.  Lethal consequences of an unknown variety were experienced in such a district in regards to the items.

                            1.  A guild-less thief who stole one of the unknown missing parts was found gutted and his spirit rent out of his body.
                            2.  Clerics pronounced him rendered spiritually unfit for life by way of vile necromancy.
                            3.  Resurrection was attempted but it failed much to the surprise of the clerics. The soul failed to answer. I am told the spirit has either risen as undead or is imprisoned somehow.

                4.  There are rumors of something that occurred at Tilverton recently to be related somehow

                    1.  none I ask seem to know the why behind the speculation.
                    2.  Nonetheless what I have heard has proven to be something that is disturbingly reminiscent of the accident occurring in this journal.
                    3.  If someone has already acquired technology such as the following to then leave a god-sized divot in the face of Faerun I fear the knowledge may be in the wrong hands.

            3.  Much of Netheril\'s history died with it during the fall Karsus

                1.  When the city-states fell those in the cities were mostly mages, the surrounding slaves on the ground that survived knew little of magic.
                2.  The life-drain magic of the Phaerimm destroyed the Netheril nation and erased a good deal of survivors
                3.  The slaves that escaped were happy to leave their masters behind them and left little record of their time there for sages such as myself

        2.  Difficult to corroborate information in the covert archives.

        3.  Report

            1.  Data

                1.  Title: Important experimental results, day 263
                2.  Subject: Presenting theory of demiplane mechanics for Celebrindal\'s limit

                    1.  Research Log

                        1.  It is possible to create and maintain a large scale transitory demiplane accessible remotely that can support multiple areas of self-collapsed mutli-prime coterminous planes.

                            1.  Proof of reasonable energy consumption to create core multiverse energy matrix of folded topology

                                1.  Success

                                    1.  Energy consumption is projected to total within circle 13
                                    2.  Total consumption does not exceed planar density limitation.

                                2.  New research theory

                                    1.  Energy consumption may be further reduced by decentralizing control and regulation structure to mostly eliminate transport inefficiency

                            2.  Proof of a stable multiverse energy matrix of folded topology

                                1.  Success

                                    1.   a small scalar energy matrix was created in folded topology
                                    2.   It did not persist long but interior scans were sufficient to properly identify it.

                                2.  Empirical Observation

                                    1.  The energy matrix has a nature that vents energy into the inner volume of the hypersphere
                                    2.  This answers the previously unknown energy transfers observed in some equations testing.

                                3.  New research theory

                                    1.  It may be possible to use the inner trans-dimensional space as capacitor of relatively infinite volume by inserting a mechanism to control the direction and amount of leakage.

                                4.  New research theory

                                    1.  It may be possible to use these temporary vents in leakage through the hypersphere to provide entry points for the normally self-collapsed planes.

                            3.  Proof of a extradimensional space which can accept multiple prime material planes.

                                1.  Initial failure

                                    1.  Unexpected uncontrollable merging resulted in a systemic failure in containment.
                                    2.  Experiment area is a total loss.

                                2.  Empirical observation:

                                    1.  The explosion resulted in a portion of the consumed mass being reconstituted into duplicate parts of the remaining half.
                                    2.  The matter was completely unstable and reverted to its component material within the hour.
                                    3.   Further investigation found various amalgamate minerals present in the debris that did not exist in the original matter.
                                    4.  The unknown material caused sickness in one of the subordinates.
                                    5.  Materials deemed hazardous and Sealed under heavy protection for further research.

                                3.  Research Progress:

                                    1.  Lab rebuilt with adjustments to minimize planar interference.

                                4.  Research test, failure

                                    1.  The new rituals to construct the extradimensional space put redundancies in place to handle interference
                                    2.  This new behavior vastly increased stability but still resulted in a destabilization of the extradimensional space if considerably safer.

                                5.  Research Observation:

                                    1.  The instability has been found to result from the decentralized glyph work undergoing some form of natural sorting.
                                    2.  This may be an unintended side-effect of the adaptive pattern selection imposed on the structure.

                                6.  Research progress:

                                    1.  Rather than control the side effect with methods that may not be beneficial in the long-term I have instead altered the Tamarind\'s screen so that the glyph work is more reliably sorted into stable patterns.
                                    2.  This change should self-correct any errors until I have a more developed understanding of the effect.

                                7.  Research progress

                                    1.  The mutable nature of the aberration has proven difficult to study.
                                    2.  There are evasions being used that belie some form of intelligence in the patterns chosen

                                8.  Research progress

                                    1.  I have successfully located and examined foreign glyph work tampering with the system.
                                    2.  I will study the effect but for now the glyph work matrix in my lab is contained and stable.

                                9.  Empirical observation:

                                    1.  I have located the source of the foreign glyph work.
                                    2.  It is a copy of portions of my true name thus why it eluded me with my own skills expertly.
                                    3.  What little intelligence it has is too disjointed to be anything other than animus-level.

                                10. Research progress:

                                    1.  I have located the system of sub-patterns producing the effect.
                                    2.  The self-correcting nature of the new Tamarind\'s screen copy pieces needed to self-correct from snippets of true names in its environment.
                                    3.  The learning system borrows almost randomly though it has proven to be ingenious in solutions to some simple issues through trial and error.

                                11. Research progress:

                                    1.  I have located and refined the disjointed sub-patterns created from the Tamarind\'s screen into a primitive managing proto-construct.
                                    2.  I will create a new multi-prime extradimensional space with the new glyph work to see if it remains stable.

                                12. Empirical observation:

                                    1.  A simple ring of protection had its coherent magical properties gutted in favor of temporary changes to stabilize the local space due to the rings effects.
                                    2.  Part of the ring\'s matter was consumed as well and vented into the core gate\'s interior space.

                                13. Partial success:

                                    1.  The new extradimensional space remains stable in the long term but has severe effects on anything entering the space.
                                    2.  Containing the regulating proto-construct has proven exceedingly difficult to contain on the inside of the sub-planes due to indiscriminate pattern loss from objects passing into it.

                                14. New theory:

                                    1.  It may be possible to have the managing construct exist outside the created extradimensional space as a more reliable artifice.
                                    2.  The main conjugate gate would only have access to the extradimensional spaces from the outside.
                                    3.  Since their realities are self-collapsed the matter or patterns inside should not be at risk since they do not exist from the reference point of the new artifice or core system.

                                15. Success:

                                    1.  Creating an unrefined version of the managing construct outside the system while providing linkage to its interior has made the extradimensional space resistant to extreme external stress.
                                    2.  There is sufficient stability in the space\'s matrix to withstand alterations in its topology.

                                16. Addendum:

                                    1.  Multiple managing artifice in a connected space severely interfere with each other.
                                    2.  Experiment vault damaged by implosion.
                                    3.  Minimal damage to superstructure and personnel.

                            4.  Proof of a stable multi-prime coterminous extradimensional space for a safe failure mode.

                                1.  Failure:

                                    1.  Appears stable but a rock used for testing was erratically distributed throughout coterminous prime planes and the transit caused surges in the artifice, prototype lost.
                                    2.  Dias in experiment vault sustained minor damage.

                                2.  Addendum:

                                    1.  Missing matter has been located during repair as it was vented into the dias base.
                                    2.  Dias being replaced for expediency of research.

                                3.  Research progress:

                                    1.  Testing has determined that the managing artifice attempts to diverge along the multiple prime planes.
                                    2.  Coherency methods have been instituted as to evenly distribute the control apparatus\'s attention.

                                4.  Research progress:

                                    1.  Problem of dispersion remains in coterminous multi-prime planes.
                                    2.  Surge has faster acceleration if less severe buildup.
                                    3.  Inspection of the glyph work determined that resonance is occurring within the patterns themselves.

                                5.  Partial success:

                                    1.  Glyph work redesigned to reduce the propagation of resonance within energy patterns.
                                    2.  Attempt at constructing new multi-prime plane failed.
                                    3.  Resonance was tolerable but the system was unstable and imploded.
                                    4.  Implosion caused insignificant damage due to reinforced dias.

                                6.  Research progress:

                                    1.  Feedback loop within glyph work identified, managing artifice was attempting to adjust its own topology which caused attempts to repair the change spawning more adjustments.
                                    2.  Glyph work adjusted to eliminate feedback loop.

                                7.  Success:

                                    1.  With the feedback loop eliminated pattern adaptivity appears to have been reduced significantly
                                    2.  the multi-prime coterminous extradimensional space is stable only for limited durations
                                    3.  Multi-prime extradimensional space survived minor stress testing using offensive spells.

                            5.  Proof of a stable extradimensional space which is tolerant of foreign extradimensional spaces (convex topology)

                                1.  Failure:

                                    1.  Initial attempt to insert small bag of holding into core-foreign extradimensional space resulted in spatial implosion.
                                    2.  Minor damage to dias.

                                2.  Research progress:

                                    1.  Observations of the usage in glyph work inside the core-foreign extradimensional space indicate the managing artifact is fully depleted by the foreign extradimensional space.
                                    2.  New managing artifact created with provision for depletion.

                                3.  Empirical observation:

                                    1.  Depletion takes about four and a half seconds which is curiously the cycle time for synchronization of the managing artifice to the four prime planes within the core-foreign extradimensional space.
                                    2.  Full depletion is never lesser than the cycle time.

                                4.  Research progress:

                                    1.  Core artifice experiences feedback due to nonuniform time passage between the containing core-foreign extradimensional space and the smaller extradimensional space.

                                5.  Working research theory:

                                    1.  As the accumulated temporal difference between extradimensional spaces accelerates across the smaller entry horizon inside the core-foreign plane, eventually the local space cannot withstand the inequality and a tear opens in place of the proper horizon.
                                    2.  Once this occurs both sides are now non-convex spaces which externally collapse each other resulting in the spatial tear in local space as they lose contact with the plane.

                                6.  Working research theory addendum:

                                    1.  Temporal differences seem to not only be the sole buildup along the improperly functioning horizon.
                                    2.  It is unknown at this time what other effects affect the loss of synchronization.

                                7.  Research progress:

                                    1.  A local point of reference is being created as a modified scrying endpoint.
                                    2.  Functions properly in testing and should provide a point of reference for the managing artifice to deal with unrealized potentials.

                                8.  Partial success:

                                    1.  Endpoint sensor integrated into existing artifice works as intended.
                                    2.  Partial integration of the scrying glyph work is not permitting the managing artifice to operate very efficiently
                                    3.  The core-foreign plane imploded at one and a third days after it desynchronized over an extended period.

                                9.  Partial success addendum:

                                    1.  Managing artifice recreated and altered to add the endpoint sensor capacity.

                                10. Research progress:

                                    1.  Integrated endpoint sensors are operating above expectations
                                    2.  Managing artifice has more tightly adapted itself into the sensory capabilities.
                                    3.  Rudimentary intellect seems to drive attempts for the sensor to leave the core-foreign plane.

                                11. Research progress:

                                    1.  Managing artifice has been recreated to be able to initiate multiple internal points of reference.
                                    2.  This should handle a reasonable amount of foreign extradimensional spaces.

                                12. Success:

                                    1.  Core-foreign extradimensional space has accepted a bag of holding with an observed reference point synchronizing all space inside even if the entry point is closed.
                                    2.  It is still possible for the implosion to happen as much as in normal space if two foreign extradimensional spaces are recursed.
                                    3.  Considered a non-issue due to existing safety habits among mages carrying such items.

                                13. Success addendum:

                                    1.  Entry of a large volume of miniature collapsed spaces within the core-foreign gate was handled as expected.
                                    2.  Artifice sustained minor melting damage due to energy exertion.

                                14. Future safety modification:

                                    1.  Provisions made for next managing artifice revision to integrate stasis encystment methods.
                                    2.  This would handle a potentially excessive number of self-collapsed spaces for available power at the satellite gate.

                            6.  Proof of spatial compatibility in induced system symmetry between nearby convex extradimensional spaces.

                                1.  Failure:

                                    1.  Introduction of multiple managing artifice resulted in total system implosion as per previous attempt despite recent improvements.

                                        Damage to facilities: dias, heavily damaged; lab, minor damage; one subordinate, complete liquefaction. No damage to apprentice or myself.

                                    2.  A new subordinate will need to be trained after repairs complete.

                                2.  Research progress:

                                    1.  After heavily isolating the multiple control artifice with conduit envelopes and antimagic fields I have determined that the two artifice are communicating or interfacing in some not yet handled fashion.
                                    2.  I will review all glyph work for possible errors in my methods.

                                3.  Research progress:

                                    1.  Experiments with patterns leaking across the two artifice indicate that they are interacting as a whole interface but still attempting to normalize each other.
                                    2.  Once too much manipulation effort is ongoing the realities do not receive enough attention and thus rupture.

                                4.  Redesign:

                                    1.  Modifications to allow the individual artifice direct access to each other have inspired me with a distributed control framework.
                                    2.  This will require a ground-up redesign.

                                5.  Redesign progress:

                                    1.  Current activities promising as test indicates that proper central handling can induce a hive mind in the apparatus that stabilizes over time in spite of nearby similar artifice.
                                    2.  Possible segue into construct sentience.

                                6.  Redesign progress:

                                    1.  Design complete but possible side effects my occur due to adaptive nature of the artifice.
                                    2.  Measures are in place to ensure nondestructive mechanics improvement.

                                7.  Research progress:

                                    1.  Initial construction of core gate managing artifice is online

                                8.  Research progress:

                                    1.  Construction of two managing artifice for core-foreign gates is complete.
                                    2.  They will be closely studied for pattern changes

                                9.  Empirical observation:

                                    1.  A test of the core-foreign extradimensional space for stability was done.
                                    2.  Upon the 5th trial a counter spell emanated from the core-foreign managing artifice and thereafter multiple gates began exhibiting the behavior.
                                    3.  Attempts made later that day resumed their effectiveness.

                                10. Empirical observation:

                                    1.  Repeated resistance was met in testing but it was later noticed by my apprentice that the counter spells were extremely close to the style of the caster themselves.

                                11. Empirical observation:

                                    1.  It has been confirmed that the initial commonality structure I created has developed into something altogether different.
                                    2.  The construct intelligence is comprising itself of the intellects that interact with it but its memory seems inherently temporary.
                                    3.  Patterns used from those being borrowed from remain with their host and once the intelligence loses contact with them it loses use of the skill.

                                12. Research progress:

                                    1.  After examining the behavior of the intellect in detail I have discovered a new construct intelligence structure.
                                    2.  After deconstruction of the core-foreign manipulation artifice I have altered the design for a proper implementation of the new intelligence structure.
                                    3.  I have named it a meta-sentient.
                                    4.  Structure by nature has no opinion of its own except that which it borrows.

                                13. Research progress:

                                    1.  The meta-sentient structure\'s method of choosing patterns has been altered to completely avoid emotive thought.
                                    2.  This should concrete its thought and reduce the possibility of borrowing dangerous ideals.

                                14. Success:

                                    1.  The commonality enforces nearly complete symmetry across all gates.
                                    2.  There is no observable resonance between realities that would cause them to collapse.

                                15. Safety modification:

                                    1.  The meta-sentient has had goals for self-improvement changed so that they are more momentary.
                                    2.  The meta-sentient accepted the modifications and this should inhibit the adoption of any long-term drive by the meta-sentient.
                                    3.  As a caveat: this also inhibits any semblance of self-preservation but that is an acceptable loss.

                            7.  Proof of a controllable merge dynamic (linearly progressing) between multi-prime extradimensional spaces and a multiverse planar space matrix tolerant to changes in the locally folded topology.

                                1.  Research progress:

                                    1.  proceeding faster than expected.
                                    2.  Initial tests went well but it has been determined that the amount of energy required for the two systems to merge controllably may be unreasonable for both to maintain.

                                2.  Research progress:

                                    1.  Merging dynamics have been observed to superposition then fracture into a smaller space.
                                    2.  Both gates must have a sum of their two energy requirements in order to successfully maintain their reference to the superpositioned space.

                                3.  Failure:

                                    1.  Having at least double the total energy available at every core-foreign gate is unnecessarily wasteful.
                                    2.  I will investigate if there is a more elegant solution.

                                4.  Research progress:

                                    1.  It may be possible to merge if both core-foreign gates drop to a single prime space.

                                5.  Research progress:

                                    1.  Experiments on temporarily dropping multiple prime spaces in favor of a merge returned promising results.
                                    2.  The systems reacted in a controlled fashion but current control methods were lacking.

                                6.  Breakthrough:

                                    1.  In experimenting with new control methods an error induced from artifice damage resulted in one of the prime planes trading place in the same slice of the other core-foreign gate.

                                7.  Research progress:

                                    1.  Merges are possible but must be maintained in an envelope that can expand between the multi-prime planes in a short enough span so that the entire system does not build up enough unrealized potentials that it damages the core envelope.

                                8.  Research progress:

                                    1.  The realities will switch places if induced to move slightly toward one side or the other.
                                    2.  This isn\'t a full merge of realities but it serves the same purpose

                                9.  Success:

                                    1.  A lab rat used to test the merged space arrived in the destination core-foreign gate with recoverable or avoidable damage.
                                    2.  Died of burns and internal bleeding due to buffeting of local space and unstable temperatures.

                                10. Addendum:

                                    1.  Protective equipment is necessary to complete the transfer by most organic creatures but it may grow stable if the envelope of realities comprises more planes.

                            8.  Proof of exponentially increasing matrix stability for each merged multi-prime space

                                1.  Research progress:

                                    1.  A third core-foreign gate has been constructed.
                                    2.  The new artifice merged into the meta-sentient with no difficulties.

                                2.  Working theory: Disconnected host-implosion

                                    1.  Initial theory work indicates that the pattern of the merge envelope may need to be convex in of itself on the larger space of the host conjugate gate.
                                    2.  A core-foreign gate inside of a linked envelope of core-foreign prime planes would be disconnected from the whole and likely implode due to unrealized potentialities.

                                3.  Research progress:

                                    1.  A fourth core-foreign gate was constructed in a secondary lab as to test the host-implosion theory.

                                4.  Research progress:

                                    1.  Creating the envelope around multiple prime planes operated close to expectations but induced spatial movement did not churn the realities.

                                5.  Success:

                                    1.  After making alterations to provide for a controllable direction to induced planar movement the core-foreign gates churned their enveloped sub-planes as expected.
                                    2.  The stability of the system increased as a larger amount of planar space was inside the envelope.

                                6.  Theory:

                                    1.  A control apparatus for communicating through the meta-sentient to provide appropriate force to move a particular prime plane around large envelopes could be developed.

                            9.  Proof of externalities tolerance between the conjugate gate system and its host plane activity.

                                1.  Research progress:

                                    1.  A teleport circle that proceeds through the core-foreign space is being constructed.

                                2.  Research test, failure:

                                    1.  Attempt to send lab rat through the gate horizon resulted in matter scattered into core-foreign gates all along the path of transit.

                                3.  Research progress:

                                    1.  modifications are being made to the core foreign gate to impose an envelope along the entire merged area to prevent portal threads from successfully establishing through self-collapsing puncture-tolerant space.

                                4.  Research progress:

                                    1.  Modification testing inhibited any entry into the core-foreign gates as expected
                                    2.  Teleport circle collapsed upon ignition as its charge thread impacted the larger envelope.

                                5.  Research test, partial success:

                                    1.  Another attempt to send lab rat through portal resulted in an intact lab rat whose animus is missing after circle ignition failed.
                                    2.  Suspect possible grounding of portal conduit along envelope just before collapse.

                                6.  Research progress:

                                    1.  Grounding has been dealt with by improving envelope structure to deflect other envelopes.

                                7.  Research test, success:

                                    1.   All lab rats successfully entered and exited teleport circle and exited on the intended destination with no ill effects.
                                    2.  Scrying apparatus indicates that the teleport conduit is properly deforming around the sealed envelopes and is no longer grounding to the potential upon the surface of the larger area.

                                8.  Research progress:

                                    1.  I have a theory to punch temporary holes in the external protective envelope of the core.
                                    2.  Experimental spells are promising but further research is needed for a stable modification to the inscribed spell.

                                9.  Research progress:

                                    1.  I have modified the envelope with a variant of gate spells to attempt to allow use of the conjugate gate with an envelope in place.

                                10. Research test, failure:

                                    1.  Use of the new construction unexpectedly resulted in a vortex that vented local space into the area.
                                    2.  The management artifice controlled the loss sufficiently before depleting so that the conjugate gate could be shut down.
                                    3.  Minor facility damage, experiment chamber door must be replaced. Some low value equipment loss. No damage to reinforced experiment chamber.

                                11. Research note:

                                    1.  Recent test seems to have inspired my apprentice to some end but apprentice Starblade says that it is not directly related.
                                    2.  I skimmed the paper and agree it is a plausible theory. May be useful for stated weapons applications.
                                    3.  I have instructed him to more fully record his project for later research.

                                12. Research progress:

                                    1.  Facility is currently being repaired, I will spend the intervening time researching the recent failure as well as other ways to safely allow entry past the envelope.

                                13. Hypothesis:

                                    1.  It is now my understanding that due to the nature of the gates, connecting an external envelope to the core-foreign gates results in a channel where internal pressure results from attempts to correct the non-convex shape of the connected envelope and core-foreign space.
                                    2.  The pressure on the extradimensional space to tear from the core to merge with the envelope results in excessive gravity stress as well as a mana or elemental energy drain of apparent vast capacity.

                                14. Recommendation/promotion:

                                    1.  With this research from my apprentice it is my recommendation he be given resources and project head authority to fully investigate this behavior for weapons applications once this existing project completes.
                                    2.  Thus I am promoting Darkavien Starblade from apprentice to lay artificer.

                                15. Research progress:

                                    1.  Rather than form a gate conduit across the envelope it is the opinion of I and my new colleague Darkavien that the existing method of ensuring balanced potentials on contained extradimensional spaces can be purposed for use in crossing the envelope.
                                    2.  This is accomplished by a moment-based teleportation across the gap into local space.
                                    3.  This will break the connection across the gap while allowing the package to be unwrapped and merged by the local meta-sentient.

                                16. Research progress:

                                    1.  It is our opinion that a scrying node will be needed on the outside of the envelope as well as the inside.
                                    2.  This is easily tied to the main meta-sentient and construction has already begun.

                                17. Research progress:

                                    1.  Scrying has proven successfully observed from the core facility to the immediate external vicinity of an active core-foreign gate.

                                18. Research progress:

                                    1.  Range of the external scrying nodes while inactive is approximately twice the core-foreign gate diameter.
                                    2.  While active and conjoined the external scrying range is approximately twice the difference in size between the larger core gate and the smaller core-foreign gate.
                                    3.  This is likely a static range but the mutative nature of the meta-sentient has made it difficult to observe its exact qualities.

                                19. Research progress:

                                    1.  Darkavien has produced a teleport that can merge to existing core structure and provide an appropriate volume tolerance.
                                    2.  I have provided the necessary changes to the meta-sentient so it can effectively and safely use the new transit.
                                    3.  The entry behavior has been mutually named "horizon" opening as it is not a connected gate in the normal sense.

                                20. Research test, success with caveats:

                                    1.  The horizon modifications proved to work as theorized however moment of storage was less than expected due to inefficiencies that were discovered in testing.
                                    2.  New materials to improve mechanical hardware have been requested.
                                    3.  Meta-sentient use will need to be adjusted to refuse packets larger than the discrete entry volume of the horizon.
                                    4.  Objects entering larger than the intended maximum volume were dismembered. Darkavien\'s hand was dismembered while delivering the volume test.
                                    5.  Local cleric successfully regenerated Darkavien\'s hand and research continues as unimpeded.

                                21. Research progress:

                                    1.  Darkavien\'s new horizon artifice and my new meta-sentient instructions proved vastly more efficient over the initial incarnation.
                                    2.  Research will continue once a full maintenance cycle has completed.

                                22. Success:

                                    1.  Test using new horizon equipment was successful.
                                    2.  Entry envelope horizon altered to correct the lensing effect of the disparate volume spaces of the respective core and core-foreign gate sizes.
                                    3.  The horizon effect though though localized for specific transit does vent some light from inside the conjoined spaces giving a translucent overlay of all objects passing through the core-foreign plane stack.

                                23. Research addendum:

                                    1.  Horizon leak effect deemed a desired ability and it has been refined through explicit handling.
                                    2.  Horizon slightly more efficient due to tighter control of the horizon size.
                                    3.  Lensing effect left in place as it was deemed not necessary to spend energy in its correction.

                            10. Proof of nonlinear systemic entropy loss that plateaus as the percentage change in total merged realities decreases for each new self-collapsed convex multi-prime coterminous extradimensional space superpositioned onto the conjugate gate\'s larger more stable host matrix.

                                1.  Research progress:

                                    1.  More management nodes under construction.
                                    2.  6 new core-foreign gates now active.

                                2.  Research progress:

                                    1.  Changes were made to more efficiently collate the data from the meta-sentient.
                                    2.  Darkavien has produced a more cogent control apparatus.
                                    3.  Experiment viewing chamber may need expansion.

                                3.  Research progress:

                                    1.  Control areas fully tested.
                                    2.  Various issues with accuracy and coolant will be resolved before research progresses.

                                4.  Research progress:

                                    1.  All significant issues with controls have been resolved.
                                    2.  Tested and verified with known good behavior.

                                5.  Success:

                                    1.  Core-foreign gates were brought online singly and values were meticulously kept.
                                    2.  Recorded mana consumption decreased per core-foreign gate and overall system entropy decreased in the core planar matrix as a whole.
                                    3.  As disturbances from entropy along the core planar matrix decreased energy efficiency increased markedly.

                                6.  Research note:

                                    1.  Momentary severe energy loss events were registered as some gates spatially close to a newly arriving gate conformed to the new order of the changed whole.
                                    2.  This may need to be resolved or handled.

                            11. Proof of disruption of locality only should a superpositioned space be rendered unsustainable.

                                1.  Research progress:

                                    1.  Detonating a wand in one of the core-foreign gates resulted in the multi-prime stack being violated.
                                    2.  The local envelope did not hold as well as expected and a nearby core-foreign gate almost collapsed due to the ripple of planar stress.

                                2.  Research progress:

                                    1.  Improperly functioning meta-sentient instructions have been found that resulted in the nearby core-foreign gates to attempt to reconcile the wave of deformation rather than passing over it.
                                    2.  These issues have been since corrected and the core-foreign gates will instead ride over the wave of deformation until the core gate matrix self-corrects.

                                3.  Research progress:

                                    1.  A full review of the meta-sentient instructions regarding energy balance, pattern selection, and damage control was undertaken to refine the understanding of interaction possibilities.
                                    2.  We have resolved number of possible factors that may be influencing the poor isolation of spaces.

                                4.  Success:

                                    1.  A severe detonation was redirected to the local system as a whole and the multi-planar stack retained its convex nature while preventing the cascading of damage.
                                    2.  All matter in the collapsed plane stack was destroyed but the core-foreign system overall was preserved.

                            12. Proof of safe methods to repair minor damage internally to the convex superpositioned spaces without requiring recreation.

                                1.  Research progress:

                                    1.  Stasis encystment methods were brought up by Darkavien to handle just such a difficulty.
                                    2.  The core artifice will be revisited and rebuilt in its entirety to account for a more functionally distinct structure.

                                2.  Research progress:

                                    1.  All cores have been rebuilt and progress is being made on stasis encystment controls.
                                    2.  I will be working on stable but temporally inert extradimensional spaces to use as cysts to contain damage.
                                    3.  Darkavien will be constructing the artifice.

                                3.  Research progress:

                                    1.  Darkavien requires specially prepared materials to ensure stable handling.
                                    2.  Glyph work for the meta-sentient will be on hold while we produce the custom materials.

                                4.  Research progress:

                                    1.  Replacement glyph work was accepted by the new meta-sentient
                                    2.  The new artifice integrated quicker than expected thanks to a new modular base.

                                5.  Failure:

                                    1.  Intentionally damaging the plane surface resulted in only a partial encystment.
                                    2.  This may be an equipment limitation or poor selection of total damaged area on the part of the meta-sentient.

                                6.  Research progress:

                                    1.  Meta-sentient has insufficient data to properly assess large amounts of damage.
                                    2.  Additional scry points have been added to the core gate\'s point of reference as well as to the core-foreign gates.

                                7.  Success:

                                    1.  Damage to the local plane stack from a test exploding wand was isolated and vented to the inside of the core gate where it could detonate harmlessly.
                                    2.  This prevents the need for complete recreation as long as the damage can be isolated before it destabilizes the system as a whole.

                            13. Theoretical proof that instantiation properties can be applied to superpositioned space that could recover perturbations of a normally convex space provided existing unused space is present on the host plane matrix.

                                1.  Research progress:

                                    1.  Additional core conjugate gate sourcers are being constructed to provide for a larger sized core surface.
                                    2.  The additional energy should allow a human-sized core-foreign gate to exist.

                                2.  Research progress:

                                    1.  Some pieces of the core artifice had to be redesigned to accommodate a larger scale of energy.
                                    2.  No difficulties encountered and various energy distribution conduits were made multi-headed to allow for future expansion.

                                3.  Research theory:

                                    1.  It may be possible to use some of the mass vented into the center of the core plane envelope to fuel self-repair of various gate hardware.

                                4.  Research progress:

                                    1.  New core operating as desired with unused space available.

                                5.  Research progress:

                                    1.  Darkavien and I will be designing glyph work for the meta-sentient that will recover non-hazardous space from the immediate reflex of the encystment.

                                6.  Research progress:

                                    1.  Theoretical testing of recovery for stasis space produced cascading temporal issues that are being resolved before experimental testing

                                7.  Partial Success:

                                    1.  Damage to the core-foreign gate plane producing sufficient damage while in range of a lab rat was properly isolated from local space and vented as deteriorating self-collapsed space squeezing out of the core-gate\'s topology.
                                    2.  Glyph work recovered the rat deeming it not to be damage but the rat arrived dead.
                                    3.  Dissection of lab rat revealed death by ceasing of the bodily functions.

                                8.  Research progress:

                                    1.  Speed in the encystment glyph work was resolved as to minimize the amount of time the spirit is functioning while it cannot interact with the animus.
                                    2.  The encystment process should now be reasonably non-lethal.

                                9.  Success:

                                    1.  Earlier test was repeated and the damage was vented into interior core space for safe detonation while the rat was returned whole.
                                    2.  Rat quite alive but exhibiting signs of sensory deprivation and pain though the animal\'s behavior returned to normal after a few days. Rat exhibits minor paranoia.

                                10. Research note:

                                    1.  Glyph work was adjusted to carve and return as many distinct spaces as fast as possible as to reduce spirit burn due to disconnection of live subjects.
                                    2.  Further expansion of the scrying functions, to discern and thus prioritize living over nonliving material, may be undertaken later.

                            14. Proof of instantiation behavior in entire superpositioned spaces on large stable host matrices of core conjugate gates

                                1.  Research progress:

                                    1.  Initial testing of methods by hand to avoid a potentially hazardous test failure raise the possibility that excessive energy requirements of taking on a potentially large amount of volume.
                                    2.  Large amounts of material may result in artifice failure in the receiving core-foreign gate and thus cascade through all active gates in the system as matter accumulates for redistribution.

                                2.  Research progress:

                                    1.  We have constructed glyph work instructions that should avoid the cascade in making the core conjugate gate encyst the unsupported superpositioned space into discrete units.
                                    2.  These discrete units can then be partitioned across all active gates so the overload condition does not occur.

                                3.  Research test, success:

                                    1.  A test of automated space partitioning successfully vented a pile of garbage into discrete materials with minimal cleaving occurring on any minor solid masses.
                                    2.  Further refinement of existing glyph work should reduce cleaving along most spaces.
                                    3.  Large spaces were heavily cleaved and some sorting of size via apparent system energy may need to occur.

                                4.  Research progress:

                                    1.  Darkavien has altered the scrying glyph work so that the central meta-sentience may more accurately determine size of a coherent object.
                                    2.  In the meantime I will study the artifice portion dealing directly with maintaining scry points.

                                5.  Research progress:

                                    1.  I have rebuilt the scrying artifice to allow for easy integration of new glyph work in self-contained scry spheres that control their own method of observation.
                                    2.  This should ease expansion of sensory methods in the future.

                                6.  Research progress:

                                    1.  Testing of the new scrying artifice has determined that the new self-contained sensory apparatus help distance any internal glyph interference.
                                    2.  Darkavien has instituted new glyphs to help distribute scry point attentions and with improved sensory detail cleaving has been reduced.
                                    3.  Cleaving along large volumes is still a concern but recent testing has proved the cleave selection to be more deliberate thanks to clearer data.

                                7.  Success:

                                    1.  Previous research test was duplicated with chattel and refuse and the chattel arrived intact among the five other core-foreign gates when the managing artifice they were entered into was disabled. .
                                    2.  Additional types of scry points can be added but The chattel were preferred as discrete units over most other garbage.
                                    3.  Deemed a success since further safety measures for actual persons will only need construction rather than express research.

                                8.  Success addendum:

                                    1.  Additional spheres were added that discern life and mana levels in contained discrete units.
                                    2.  A secondary test using chattel returned all chattel successfully as well as most refuse of high density.
                                    3.  Chattel from the secondary test exhibited signs of terror and pain as well as the sensory deprivation but given communication was impossible further information during the experience was not available.
                                    4.  Tertiary testing of volunteer subordinates returned subordinates in favor of magic-less chattel. Two chattel received in what appears to be an attempt by the meta-sentient to return both in recoverable damage.
                                    5.  Volunteer subordinates from tertiary testing were informed before testing of the after-effects and these effects were verified that subordinates were distressed by the sensory deprivation but through messaging on both sides it was determined that there were no other adverse effects than some tolerable pain.
                                    6.   Chattel from tertiary testing exhibited same behavior as the second test. It is unadvised that anyone other than trained persons be allowed through a hazardous gate transit and that they be informed of the emergency procedures as to not cause mental damage to valuable personnel.

                            15. Theoretical proof of model for multi-conjugate gate matrices for interlinking across long distances

                                1.  Research progress:

                                    1.  Suitable plane being researched to facilitate testing.
                                    2.  Once a location has been researched lay artificer Darkavien will leave for that location to construct a new core.

                                2.  Research progress:

                                    1.  Darkavien has researched a suitable location on a remote plane. Construction will proceed as materials are available.
                                    2.  The distant gate will be an additional four-satellite conjugate for use in testing.
                                    3.  Designs will be a duplicate of the existing conjugate gate.

                                3.  Research progress:

                                    1.  Darkavien is now proceeding with the construction of the remote conjugate gate.
                                    2.  In the meantime I will be doing a full maintenance cycle of all equipment and replacing any worn components.

                                4.  Research progress:

                                    1.  Darkavien is done with the core artifice of the remote gate.
                                    2.  I have repaired or replaced various parts in the core artifice but excessive wear necessitates improvement in order to ensure long-term use at these higher energy levels.

                                5.  Research progress:

                                    1.  Darkavien has reported that one of the four core-foreign gates of the remote conjugate gate is now complete and a second is in construction.
                                    2.  I am investigating methods of mending artifice from mass vented into the core-foreign gate or possibly the environment around the core artifice.

                                6.  Research progress:

                                    1.  Attempts to produce a crystal that mends its local environment have proven difficult.
                                    2.  It may need to be a derived artifice of the conjugate gate in order for the complexity to be handled properly.
                                    3.  I will be researching glyph work that produces the mending effect so it can integrate into the management artifice.
                                    4.  This should enable a modified minor creation with environmental sources for reagents while allowing the glyph work to be aware of the correct form of the overall mutable management artifice.
                                    5.  Darkavien has reported that two of four core-foreign management artifice are now completed.

                                7.  Apprentice evaluation:

                                    1.  This will be my final evaluation of my apprentice Darkavien Starblade: It is my judgment that Darkavien has sufficient skill to have earned his rank of lay artificer.
                                    2.  Ingenuity and ruthless pursuit of solutions to taxing issues will prove advantageous to the cabal.
                                    3.  It will be my pleasure to work with Darkavien in the future and he should be permitted to research a side-interest in necromancy.
                                    4.  Recent activities brought to my attention are intriguing enough that his appropriation of resources from this project be allowed to continue.
                                    5.  It is likely that Darkavien has begun his first project already given reports submitted to me.
                                    6.  Weaponization of this technology goes hand in hand with current goals so the use of this project\'s resources is deemed beneficial.
                                    7.  Darkavien will be informed of his next project\'s approved status and he will be receiving assistance from myself periodically with some particularly vexing issues.

                                8.  Research progress:

                                    1.  Darkavien has informed me that the remaining two core-foreign gates at the secondary site will be completed this week.
                                    2.  I have completed the initial design of the mending crystals. I will test it with basic architecture before integrating into the larger core-conjugate gate.
                                    3.  There has been a minor failure of the core conjugate gate. Equipment failure resulted in some containment loss, no personnel were injured as the conjugate gate was empty at the time

                                9.  Repair:

                                    1.  The equipment failure has been deemed due to premature artifice degradation.
                                    2.  Equipment involved will be replaced from spares at minimal expense.
                                    3.  Similar equipment has been inspected and some replaced for good measure.
                                    4.  Replaced equipment will be studied and logged by subordinate mages.

                                10. Research progress:

                                    1.  Equipment involved in the last degradation failure has been used to test the mending crystals
                                    2.  Other than obvious accessibility issues for repair materials the crystals are functioning as expected and equipment degradation has largely ceased
                                    3.  Bowls of metal dust have been placed around the facility for maintenance use by the crystals.
                                    4.  Upgrade of mending crystals to be placed throughout the facility have begun and the design has been sent to Darkavien for the same.

                                11. Research theory:

                                    1.  The mending crystals should be able to be adapted to intake discarded mass from the inside of the host matrix for repair materials
                                    2.  This may involve larger more powerful local subnodes to maintain the spatial conduits.
                                    3.  Research will be taken after the next major research goal as current methods are crude if both adequate and expedient.

                                12. Research progress:

                                    1.  Darkavien has completed the last core-foreign gates ahead of schedule due to approval for necromantic research and additional help.
                                    2.  Request for more slaves to be processed by Darkavien is approved to further increase possible workload.
                                    3.  Full inspections are being performed before further test cycles are undertaken.
                                    4.  Mending crystal upgrade has completed. No abnormalities detected upon their normal use.

                                13. Research progress:

                                    1.  All core-foreign gates have initiated properly.
                                    2.  Individual testing of proper conjugate gate handling is underway

                                14. Research progress:

                                    1.  All individual testing has been completed.
                                    2.  Power is being accumulated in all gates to sustain a potentially extended conjugate gate opening.
                                    3.  Additional sourcers are being constructed in the core conjugate gate to accommodate any eventuality.

                                15. Research progress:

                                    1.  All conjugate gates were powered and connected through to the conjugate gate successfully
                                    2.  There were some instabilities in processing between the local core-foreign gates and the extra planar core-foreign gates.
                                    3.  Further testing will proceed after the instabilities have a known cause.

                                16. Research progress:

                                    1.  The core conjugate gate is attempting to integrate the extra planar gates as foreign entities due to the disconnect introduced by extra planar communication artifice.
                                    2.  Communication artifice will need to be improved but the current limitation seems to be in the amount of information that needs to be transmitted and reacted to in order.
                                    3.  Additional communication artifice arrays are being constructed and the glyph conduits are being multi-headed across all major components.
                                    4.  Point to point local communications will be added for some critical components to add fault tolerance due to their sensitivity to directly linear thought.
                                    5.  Additional artifice parts are being added to those parts which have extremely linear processing requirements as to prevent issues of order in processing unrealized plane threading.

                                17. Research progress:

                                    1.  All new equipment fabricated and installed.
                                    2.  Retest of full join of the types of conjugate gates resulted in less instabilities than expected.
                                    3.  Point to point communications of local equipment are being heavily used for specific types of glyphs of the metasentient.
                                    4.  Research into the point to point use by the metasentient will need to be researched. In the meantime a point to point unit will be installed into all glyph storage units.
                                    5.  Point to point traffic has dropped markedly by the addition of point to point units installed on the sourcer.

                                18. Research progress:

                                    1.  Darkavien has reported similar results from the core-foreign gates and has advised that the point to point units be allowed to contact other core-foreign gates for the accumulation units.
                                    2.  Suggested modification has allowed for vastly increased efficiency among all sourcer storage.
                                    3.  Additional storage sourcers have been completed with all existing improvements and the core-foreign gate should withstand any unforeseen issues that arise in testing.
                                    4.  Retest of full join for all conjugate gates results in a 90% resolution rate among all conjugate gates.
                                    5.  Envelope transfer test among local gates proved a success in all aspects.
                                    6.  Envelope damage test proceeded as expected and handled a controlled explosion to above expectations.
                                    7.  Conjugate gates involved in envelope were able to evacuate the damaged area as processing the damage did not result in that conjugate plane layer becoming unstable.

                                19. Research progress:

                                    1.  Extra planar core-foreign conjugate gates exhibit exact same behavior as local and react properly to damage
                                    2.  Darkavien reported minor invasion of local plane fauna but should have repairs and cleanup completed soon.
                                    3.  Doing extra maintenance pass while cleanup is in progress at remote core-foreign gates.

                                20. Success:

                                    1.  Cleanup was completed and a full envelope was initiated around all core-foreign gates.
                                    2.  No issues presented themselves and previous behavior of core-foreign integration is completely absent.
                                    3.  There was a momentary spike in power use when a subordinate cast a fifth circle spell and this has been determined to result from the expansion of unrealized plane threading consuming above the energy allocated to that interval.
                                    4.  Further casting is disallowed unless previously accounted for.
                                    5.  Accommodating spell use can be done with existing hardware as long as the casting is previously known.
                                    6.  Adaption to account for possible spells is unnecessary as existing methods are adequate.

                                1.  Research progress:

                                    1.  I am currently developing a theory
                                    2.  Weaponing the project may be possible by altering the base states of the core conjugate plane to transmute incoming order into very high entropy matter while at high internal pressures.
                                    3.  Reagents can be used with etheric mechanics if improved adaptive systems are used to increase natural variation tolerance.
                                    4.  Meta-sentient constructs of dispersed intelligence can and are well suited for near-natural demiplane maintenance far beyond the efficiency of current ritualistic approaches using conventional methods.
