### Machine\'s precept

Credulous at best
Your desire to believe in
Angels in the hearts of being
The universe is hostile; in so impersonal
Devour to survive\... so it is, so it\'s always been
While the mother holds her child
Watches it die
Hands to hellstruck sky crying,
\'Fey, oh why?\'
Blood like rain fall down
Drawn by the grave and mound
Part vampire - Part warrior
Carnivore and Voyeur
Come to their transmittal
Sing for their death rattle
Neither the brave nor the bold
Nor brightest in stories told
None give pause until their blood is flowing
With vengeance live that their whole world dies
