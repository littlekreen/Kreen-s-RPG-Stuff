You wish hope from ill omens in light of truth

Cue from seer blind since ever-stolen youth.

Some rules may bend and to my risk may break.

Come hark now I\'ll bend them -- risk I\'ll not take.

Fleet glimpse only in plane\'s placid windy route

free of death no use for any shining beggar\'s lute.

Vision gone still shall bend an eye of dragon mind

Listen a maybe-whisper riding halls of the blind.

Will = (god name speak fortress ) = urathear ominak renthisj hurthi

Memory = scroll dragon\'s blood = iejir veth darastrix sjir

Now/Present = not tomorrow or before in = thric earenk usv ghoros persvek

Purpose = take to thief or kill to weapon = clax ekess virlym usv svent ekess laraek

One on memory in tyree speak and so take victory for darkavien\'s weapon will.
