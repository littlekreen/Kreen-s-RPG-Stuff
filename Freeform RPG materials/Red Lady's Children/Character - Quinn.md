Racial Traits 

  - **Balance of Light (ex)** -- The character is born of the structure
    of energy and divided by light. 
    
      - If in candlelight or darker the character's dark side takes
        primary form and the living one is absent. If in any light then
        the living instead and the shadow remains a projection only. 
      - The character may be divided in half by a strong directional
        light and the respective halves may make their own actions
        according to their abilities and available limbs. 
      - The character's shadow is only a projection in the light
        connected at the heart but is only ever projected at its own
        size in spite of any angles of light involved. 
      - The shadow form does not itself cast shadows though the ebon
        skin may be dimly lit. If the shadow half is regenerating due to
        damage the light half will also lack one.
      - As a shadow the dark half can see directly upward and to its
        immediate surroundings. Should something stand on or otherwise
        be within reach of the shadow it may take actions against the
        material appropriate to its strength but may not use abilities
        or magical items.

  - **Machine's cog (sp)** -- If one side is killed it bodily vanishes
    into the machine. the other half takes precedence in spite of the
    light level. During recovery the character may not take full-round
    actions until the other side wakes at full HP.
    
      - If the character is killed it resurrected by placing the body in
        any nonmagical machine whose inside is devoid of light worth at
        least 1000GP per character level at death. The machine in
        question is irreparably destroyed in the process.
      - The light half will be then assumed to be stable and have a
        regeneration effect of the character's level in HP per day from
        whatever its former negative value as long as the living half
        does not die too 
      - That day's regeneration will only take place if the other half
        materializes substance of an intelligent creature alive or dead.
      - Natural regeneration only takes place for the half that is not
        in primary control as determined by the light level. If both are
        present then neither will regenerate.

(Negative Entropy Side, Light)

  - **The Tinted Heart (sp)** -- Can innately leverage the will of the
    machine to affect the nature of substances to age or otherwise
    degrade over time. 
    
      - Impales a target substance with a multitude of colorful serrated
        tendrils linking his body with the target substance from his
        hands or other natural weapons.
      - The caster can the reverse the breakdown of a substance whether
        from coal into wood as long as it is immersed with water. The
        substance source or destination must be organic. The caster
        cannot convert water back into ice cubes. 
      - Even living substances can be produced though the caster's idea
        of the original form determines its structure. A block of wood
        transmuted in this fashion may reconstruct into a pile of short
        lived chips of live wood or the caster's favorite type of tree. 
      - This can even heal HP equal to class level plus wisdom save per
        round though the effect on strong living beings is unpredictable
        and is subject to a mandatory fortitude save for half as subdual
        damage as a spell-like effect at the caster's level. 
      - The teeth connecting the caster to the target can be severed but
        since they are constructed for each bite they do not cause
        damage. 
      - Targets take a round per hardness to convert to a previous stage
        of the material and confer 1d4 hit points to the caster per
        round spent converting.
      - Mass and substance of the material is conserved. The caster
        cannot make something larger without making it less dense or
        alter its nature so material will convert according to its
        substance and hardness. A 1' cube of sandstone can convert into
        an equal amount of glass but no amount of Iron can be converted
        into flesh.

  - Will of the machine (su)
    
      - Physical material can be harvested from the environment with a
        breath weapon (Line, Range 0) as an at-will 
      - Target can make an immedate spellcrafting check to convert the
        substance into new object with the material. If the source
        material is alive the new form may be.
      - The caster must have a relevant crafting skill to manufacture a
        complex object
      - Manufacturing a living object from another living object
        requires a Lifesmithing crafting skill. Failure results in the
        death of the malformed object depending on the scale of the
        failed transformation. Retries are only allowed as long as the
        creature continues to live. Once it dies the lifesmithing checks
        start over.
      - Imposition can restructure undead or otherwise unusual matter
        belonging to an active creature that has not been destroyed as a
        spell-like effect with a fortitude save half the character's
        level to negate. Undead are considered alive for the purposes of
        this effect though the character cannot ultimately change the
        state of the target by this means.

  - **Chorus (su)** -- The character can cause the tinted heart can
    reach out to the world to cause order in a miasma of blue fireflies
    chiming an orchestra of bells and music.
    
      - The effect has a range of 10 feet per class level or requires a
        character with a music-based or singing trained perform skill
        within earshot of the emanation to make an accompaniment of some
        kind.
      - The tinted heart causes regeneration 2 in all intelligent
        creatures that hear it and all dead organic material within
        range not part of a creature will reconstruct into living
        material of a type the caster has been exposed to. 
      - The caster takes subdual damage equal to all regeneration that
        occurs in living creatures.
      - Undead creatures or dead bodies in range will slowly approach
        their physical nature at the moment of their death. As long as
        the remains constitute the entire body once reconstituted they
        then may be subject to raise dead. 
      - The caster can resurrect a freshly deceased body if the target
        is less than half their effective class level. Raising a dead
        body in this way causes one temporary negative level to the
        caster for each class level the risen subject had at their
        death.
      - Damaged inorganic material will begin reconstructing itself or
        converting chaotically into former more complex forms.
      - Any target that experiences regeneration of limbs in this manner
        receives one temporary constitution damage from selective
        cannibalization of their possessions, environs, and/or person. 

  - **Inertia (ex)** -- The swarm is hardened against attempts to
    magically restructure the host identity. The player may choose to
    treat an unwilling transformation, physical or illusory, as if they
    were diseases but using their will save instead of fortitude.

  - **Fortress of the swarm (ex)** -- The light side of the swarm as the
    physical host can retreat into hiding and protect the host in the
    same manner. If the light side host takes a total defense action
    they gain immunity to mind affecting spells or effects that they
    were not already subject to but cannot physically defend themselves.
    The caster is also prevented from originating such effects, may not
    take a 5 foot step, or perceive their environment.

(Positive Entropy Side, Dark

  - **Alter Entropy (sp)** -- Can drain the soul of a target or cause
    inanimate creatures to rot.
    
      - Targets of inert material will degrade either in structure or
        substance. The material in question determines what will happen.
        Flesh rots, Coal ignites, glass turns to sand, worked stone
        shatters then turns to clay, or metal oxidizes.
      - Other creatures targeted whether undead or alive will be subject
        to a drain level effect with a resist DC of the caster's level
        until they qualify as inert material.
      - May target standing spells with this ability. If the spell fails
        a save its level add a wild magic effect after the spell level +
        1 number of rounds exposed to the standing spell as if the spell
        were cast on a wild magic plane.

  - **Craft Shadow (su)** The character may draw any nonmagical
    nonliving object on an unlit surface which will become real as long
    as the caster knows how to make the item or has had it in their
    possession in total darkness. 
    
      - It has all the properties of the item as long as it is not
        touched by any light source more than candlelight. 
      - If touched by light the object will simply cease to exist.
      - Creatures can be drawn in this way but require instead a story
        that describes their being. The creature persists as long as the
        substance the story is written on is not destroyed, damaged, or
        otherwise have more than candlelight shone on it. 
      - Objects created in this way cannot produce light even if they
        normally would and instead project a darkness effect of their
        normal radius of light.
      - The caster cannot have more than twice their hit die in
        creatures, objects, or alterations to the environment. 
      - The nonliving creations persist indefinitely regardless of the
        caster's range unless they dissolve from the caster creating
        more than their limit, the caster becoming unconscious due to
        injury, or the light half taking full precedence.

  - **Blackening (su) **-- As a ranged touch effect the character may
    cause one non-magical light per level to go out by draining the
    light and release them at any time. 
    
      - The light is always candlelight in the shadow half's presence
        when drained in this fashion.
      - Gain 75% concealment while sneaking through darkness while in
        total control

  - **Insubstantial (ex)** -- The character cannot be killed while in
    darkness but is otherwise subject to unconsciousness when going
    below their minimum hit points. 
    
      - If an unconscious dark half is brought into the light the light
        body will remain unconscious until the dark half has healed.
      - The character will not vanish into the machine as long as the
        light half is otherwise stable before entering the dark even if
        the dark half has sustained grievous lethal harm that would
        eventually cause death. 
      - Should the light body have been unstable before entering the
        dark the shadow half must not enter the light again or the
        light's departing soul will drag the character bodily into the
        heart of the machine.
      - The shadow cannot physically manipulate objects but while only a
        projected shadow of the light half may exert physical force on
        the host body through gripping any object shadows. Thus if the
        object is in complete shadow and the body is lit the shadow
        cannot interact with the object such as the interior of a well
        lit chest. The objects themselves will react to forces exerted
        on their shadows as if appropriate forces had been exerted on
        them.

  - **Dirge (su)** -- The dark half can sing a dirge into the fabric of
    magic that damages the emotions and rapid will of all others in
    proximity undead or living as long as they have them at all. 
    
      - This is a spell-like effect is at the character's class level
        with a will save. 
      - If the targets fail their save they are drained of all emotion
        negative or positive which ends all rage effects and suppresses
        any turn abilities as long as the dirge is maintained. 
      - Targets that pass their save need not make one again and if
        failing take a -2 circumstance penalty to attack, damage, and
        will saves.
