Thebus - "Hive replicant"

Replicate (Su) - Thebus is able to reform to an alternate version of
himself based on past or current lives. As a full hybrid he is partially
human but as humans have no similar capacity none of his summoned
identities are human. Currently it is largely random as he is too young
to retain control. Thebus' main body changes type back at least every
time he goes to sleep. 

Summoner's Seal (su) - Though as a whelp the identities may have full
control while manifested engaging in violence causes fear in the whelp.
This breaks the manifest of the currently summoned identity. The
manifested identities are aware when the seal is strained as their
connection to the world diminishes.
