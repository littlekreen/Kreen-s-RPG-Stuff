# The Fourteen's Tarot

## Description

A deck of tarot cards used in cartomancy. The deck itself is composed of
densely pressed kelp fibers and is resilient to damage. As the decks are
always magical the edges of the cards glow slightly at the veins along
the edges.

## Powers

  - The deck regenerates damage, including missing cards, when left in
    complete shadow for more than an hour per card damaged or missing in
    the majority. 
  - Any missing cards that get regenerated into the majority turn to
    dust upon being picked up elsewhere or exposed to any amount of
    light.
  - The deck confers a +5 circumstance bonus to divination abilities
    preformed with these cards that only require common bardic
    knowledge.
  - The deck may be used to genuinely answer uncommon or rarer questions
    once plus one per ten class levels within a 24 hour period, if it is
    asked to do more the diviner must make a will save DC (10 + 10 times
    the number of previous attempts) or suffer a temporary negative
    level.
  - The deck resists cheating attempts and will respond with nothing but
    fool cards if it has been tampered with until genuinely assembled
    and reshuffled. The deck will also respond with fool cards if asked
    multiple unrelated questions or if the diviner wishes the deck to
    lie.
  - To answer questions the diviner makes a bardic knowledge check at
    their current class level regardless of class. If the diviner is
    presented with directly related physical evidence unknown at the
    time of the original query the check may be retried but otherwise
    responds with fool cards if asked the same question twice.
  - The deck will always respond as the tradition and lore of the
    diviner expects it to but the images themselves will never change.
