Document

I am (name) for (department) as (position) in (company) company. I have (number) years of experience in foreign relations and translator roles. Kreen does not speak (English) fluently as such I will render this document for the construct. Also, as Kreen speaks in the third person, I will preserve its idiom for consistency. Questions should be directed to the Laird of clan MacBeathenne. Direct access to Kreen MacBeathenne will be provided to those for whom it is absolutely necessary.

Kreen has someone write in common since common is difficult for it to think in. Military persons prefer these debriefings so a kind intelligence person will restate its intent clearly. This should keep those traveling about inside of it from injuring themselves or attracting unwanted hostile attention. It and Machine keep the worst of these harmful things in mind to minimize potential damage. It warns that the Machine is not concerned at all with that which is not the property of the sphere bearer.

There are many different threats for the unwary. Rot light (translator note: This is Kreen\'s idiom for radiation) is present in many locations in the underworks. On the surface it is mostly absent. The sand surrounding the necropolis does have some damaged parts evacuated by the machine which also emit rot light. Kreen fishes these broken parts out as it has time but they should not be approached without proper protection.

Animals and plants in Kreen are not living things for conventional Faerunian definition. Many originate from such normal life but are now native. A great many live in the underworks which is better protected from the necrotic energy suffusing the ground level. Many now use it as their primary animating force through mechanisms unknown. This abnormal ethereal structure as a result cannot be affected properly by druidism or will burn by healing spells.

Building materials in the necropolis are made of green sand and facets. Understructure of the machine is instead mostly composed of metals. Most building work if metal is wrought iron. Rot light materials are present in the underworks as a part of the machine\'s natural function but life there absorbs the majority of toxic materials. There are some charnel pools in the underworks that are extremely poisonous but those that have berries are likely long since scraped clean and only contain some bones.

As the environment is suffused with necromantic energy poltergeists and other undead are very strong. Do not enter he underworks without armed escort. Machine has relinquished control of many lost due to pylon damage. The ones that are encountered in the underworks retain some consistency of thought but are unstable as well aggressively violent. They should be considered Tangos and shot on sight. Lunge distance is very high which can close rifle distance very quickly. Surface spirits are return fire only due to to predatory insects. These benign spirits are almost always unaware of any presence at all and do not attract attention by the red locusts which suppress hostile spirit action.

Weather in the necropolis is mostly consistent of mineral storms, dust storms, and spontaneous entropy loss events. In all cases shelter should be sought unless personnel need to be exposed. Rain and other conventional weather does not occur. As such all water is sourced from the reservoir. Mineral storms are normally composed of geodes of silicon carbide, amalgamate crystal, or varied heavy stone. Dust storms are uncommon but pylon damage has exposed the necropolis to some of the outside chaotic environment they wear heavily on things that are not heavily protected and allow normally ethereal spirits to easily touch living things. As the dust storms also suppress the activity of the red locusts hostile spirits will be present at ground level in volume. Entropy loss events are infrequent but an as yet unexplained feature of the machine\'s nature. Objects of any number or composition could be created during an entropy loss event and shower into the city. These events are normally preceded by a burst of alpha radiation or the sound of a large detonation. The event witnessed by ground troops hailed large dressers from altitude that did not injure any personnel due to successful evacuation. Shortly before the event time anomalies and item replication were witness. All replicated items were of inferior quality which ceased to exist with the event. Duplicated foodstuffs or water caused severe internal bleeding due to the vacuum pressure of disappearing material.

The sand sea is the area where Kreen deposits the silicon carbide crystals and dust that enters the necropolis during meteorological events. Though it appears to be buoyant enough to support travel there are hairworms living in the sand that make it dangerous for unprepared personnel to travel it. Also any malfunctioning parts of the machine are ejected here until they have self-repaired enough for reintegration but generally emit large quantities of rot light while doing so. As such personnel should avoid contact with the sand sea unless absolutely necessary or approved by a commander.

Any level not part of a building or below ground level is considered part of the underworks. Mapping the area is difficult if not impossible as the Machine freely redesigns noncritical areas as its needs require. Though infrequent it is often enough that it becomes difficult to make reliable maps for any given area. Certain area of the underworks are used for transport around the necropolis, called minor nexus, covered in the architecture section. Any personnel entering a minor nexus without first deciding where they are going will be lost inside due to security measures. This also means that the various animals and plants are completely absent in and around a minor nexus. Many locations like drainage sewers, storage areas, surface access points, or any locations attached to a static surface exit will also remain static and these can be used as navigation points if underground navigation is required. The underground areas also extend through the sand sea some distance and to each pylon. Those resident in the underworks move with these permutations though a mechanism as yet inadequately explained.

The reservoir is the main store of fresh water for the pylons ringing the necropolis. Though not stored for drinking the water is nonetheless potable to a large extent however it must be filtered before consumption. Testing indicates the water as having a very low salinity with little if any microbiological contamination so conventional filtration should be sufficient. It is unclear how the water maintains its relative sterility. No lighting is installed in the reservoir so it is very dark except for luminescent fungus that covers all support columns and walls. Air is exchanged to avoid stagnation which lessens the possibility of hypothermia since the air temperature is maintained at approximately seventy degrees with high humidity. At no point should the intake or outtake equipment be approached by boat as it can engage without warning and cause a whirlpool. All seaweed or other organisms avoid these areas diligently.

Various denizens of the necropolis are of three distinct types: firstly there are the spirits, those beings whom reside entirely in the ethereal plane and are almost entirely from formerly alive sentient beings; Second, constructs such as magically animated golems, undead formed through necromantic means, Kreen, or Kreen\'s facets being its uncollected focus; Lastly, the organisms that have become native to Kreen such as the samhain vine, red locusts, or clonefish. The varied residents are sometimes inordinately hostile but for the most part can be easily dealt with.

As Spirits are benign on the surface due to the red locusts they can often be ignored. Most simply go about their last memory and reenact it forever. They will not respond to any query in an absolute context only things which would make sense in their life. They retain no memory of those they meet as without an animus they cannot form new memories. (translator note: Kreen makes a distinction between the animating force of nonsenient life and the animating force of a sentient which is called an animus.) Many can be interacted with for information in the short term but are of little practical use or concern. There are spirits on the surface that are benign as well as cognizant but these notable spirits are often intractably silent if mentally stable at all.

In the underworks resides most of the unstable and psychotic spirits. As the hoppers are not present here the poltergeists and other strong spirits can act with impunity. Most will instantly notify any other spirit in the vicinity of another living sentient\'s presence by howl. Driven by insanity and psychosis they are likely to injure any personnel they encounter. As such energy weapons or blessed weapons should be used to dispatch these spirits before they can cause injury.

There are a few notable spirits that Kreen would prefer others are aware of before they meet them. There is a Balor dreadnought of Bane on the ground level. The outsider is still a lost but in lacking a soul is not useful to the machine. As the celestial retains much of its power extreme caution is advised when dealing with it. Also on the surface are various celestial minor of Lathander though they have forgotten their individual identities. The latter can be referred to for directions if need be but generally are silent and pious. None of the celestials have access to the divine power of their God as no deity can reach inside but the celestial major of Bane is adroit with necromancy and necrotic energy is aplenty. In the underworks Kreen has found evidence of a gardener, a painter, and a mason, but it does not know whom they were or where they generally reside.

Beyond spirits, various constructs are the primary active content of the necropolis. Various types and descriptions are present though the major populations observed will be covered. Golemhome is most of the lower sections of the necropolis though they are mostly inert. They do not present a threat unless provoked and their weaponry deals with any ethereal beings handily. Most of these are metal golems primarily of steel with humanoid frames however some stone golems are present in older sections. The warehouse at the center of Golemhome is not to be entered except by those authorized by Kreen. There are two golems that roam freely in Golemhome of significant power. Should they be present in Golemhome they can be recruited to deal with loose aggressive spirits. Other small constructs that are ubiquitous throughout the necropolis are called the \'facets\'. They are small anthropomorphous representations of Kreen\'s uncollected thought. They pose no intentional threat but given their hyperactivity, curiosity, and nonexistent attention span may pose issues by obstruction. Kreen has bolted down most of the undead constructs not under its control but skeletons are the primary population of undead constructs within the city. Wraith or other undead constructs are present in the temples ethereal but are under standing orders to not interfere with anyone inside the necropolis unless directed to do so. Nonetheless the temples should not be entered unless accompanied by trained personnel.

Various living things also reside inside the necropolis but biodiversity increases with depth. The surface has mostly samhain vine, red hoppers, and glosswing manta though other denizens from lower levels have been encountered inside buildings. The samhain vine is docile though it may scrub those personnel it encounters the vine is not itself carnivorous. Red hoppers are thermophilic and can be lethal in quantities as they seem to be able to absorb similarly large quantities of heat. Glosswing manta mostly are a nuisance in taking residence of used buildings and harrying operations until they are evicted.

The underworks is much more diverse. There are some predatory species of note in anecdotal evidence by Kreen but they have yet to be encountered by underground teams. Underground areas covered in lichen have been demonstrated to be nearly devoid of even background radiation and are recommended as cover in case of any radiation exposure. Plant-based insects that consume lichen can be used as an indicator of its presence in the nearby area. Study of other life forms in the diverse area are still ongoing.

The reservoir is the greatest source of life closest to known species. The major food sources of this vast water reserve are the deep sea kelp and a fish that native saurian humanoids eat as their primary diet. These natives to the reservoir are friendly fish-eaters that trade for light building materials and medicine. A species example of their edible fish has been removed for study but does appear to be consumable. Care must be taken that the primary fish is not eaten as there appears to be some large physical volume contained in the small fish at all times. Personell should make sure to be wary of nearly invisible jellyfish that occasionally attach to swimmers as opportunistic parasites. They can be airborne though are misty while dry. Otherwise inauspicious they pose no significant threat. The major threats inside the reservoir are catfish mimics that duplicate floating bodies of observed personnel and large arachnids nesting near the reservoir ceiling.
