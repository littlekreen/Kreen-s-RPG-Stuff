Production Phases
=================

Phase One -- Base Tools
-----------------------

This phase will be manufacturing or purchasing the tools it needs to make basic tools. Money will be obtained by the deadhands watches as Kreen was told when it first auctioned them that they sold well. The shadelings are easy for Kreen to produce though they do not last very long. Kreen may make and sell them to fill in the gaps of its financing. This phase perhaps though with friend Bitflipper\'s help it will take the longest as Kreen will be working alone as it will be unable to afford help.

### Purchases

-   Metal forging hammers, cheap x 3

    -   Kreen needs some basic hammers for forging and they are easier bought than made from scratch. Kreen expects that it will be able to purchase tools that meet its needs since it has seen metal tools around that are clearly suitable.

-   Metal chisel hammers x 3

    -   It can use its weapon to trim stone but to carve furrows or detailed things Kreen will need chisel hammers.

-   Metal chisels, cheap x 16

    -   Kreen is likely to break the metal tools but it two by eight sets should suffice until Kreen can make some more suited to its strength.

-   30m Chains x 5

    -   Kreen will need some chains to drag heavy objects or trees away from the road.

-   Metal Shovel and Pickax x 2

    -   The shovels and pickax will be needed to dig the road Kreen will use to obtain larger volumes of materials.

-   Anvil x 1

    -   Kreen will need a sturdy anvil and though this will likely cost a significant amount to what it has available Kreen can use it to make the rest of its tools.

### Sales

-   Deadhand Watch

    -   Kreen will auction a deadhand watch to get money to buy materials with.

-   Shadelings

    -   Kreen can make these temporary servants quickly and without significant materials so it will see if there is a demand for them.

### Constructed

-   Dirt Kiln x 3

    -   Kreen will need to make a few dirt kilns for bricks.
    -   They make bricks slowly and badly so Kreen will need to make bricks in volume
    -   These kilns are nothing to make needing only cobble and dirt.

-   Storage (dug) x 1

    -   A simple root cellar will be constructed underground to hold simple materials.

-   Dry workspace (dug) (5m x 5m) x 2

    -   Kreen will make a temporary dry workspace as to not get its things wet while working.

-   Unloading space (10m x 20m) x 1

    -   It shouldn\'t take Kreen long to dig a flat space for putting things down but making the cobblestone may take some time.

### Manufactured

-   Mark Road

    -   Kreen will figure out where it will connect the road to and mark with stone piles.

Phase Two -- Refined Facilities
-------------------------------

Once Kreen has crude metal and stone working tools it can begin to make superior tools. Kreen already carries what it needs for necromantic grafts so it can begin to attract workers immediately. The things it will require form the first part of many expansions in the quality of its tools. Dirty and inefficient coal will be used but Kreen will eventually dispose of its requirement for such things. Lay mages and laborers will help Kreen to produce its brick tools though once they are constructed Kreen will dismantle then primitive counterparts. Its time during idle periods for laborers will be spent digging the road bed though it should be able to gather help during the day.

### Purchases

-   Loose Stone (as much as it can afford)

    -   Kreen will destruct the stone with its weapon and make cobbles or bricks to pave and build with

-   Steel ingots x 10

    -   It will need steel if it is to make more materials and at this stage it would be more difficult to produce a smelter than it would be to buy the material at whatever cost it may be.

-   Copper ingots x 5

    -   Kreen will need some copper for alloys and direct use in tools and in the brick tools it builds.

-   Alchemical reagents

    -   to improve the stability and quality of the new kilns, hardener, and forge Kreen will need various materials.

-   Coal (500 kg)

    -   Used to fuel the forges and kilns

-   Lay mages

    -   Kreen will need mages to cast the spells on parts.
    -   They need not be very strong as these parts are fairly simple.
    -   Kreen will need mages at least of the 3<sup>rd</sup> circle.

-   Laborers

    -   Kreen will have amassed more work in a day than it can personally accomplish so Kreen will have to start looking for laborers.

### Sales

-   Replacement Necromantic Grafts

    -   Kreen will hopefully attract some laborers with injuries that will be willing to trade labor for its skills in replacing missing limbs.
    -   Replacement limbs will need to be from a blood relative not by societal joining of some nature.
    -   Hopefully none will mind necromancy used in this way.
    -   Kreen already carries the tools it needs to make these other than the metal joint it will need to work

-   Shadelings

    -   Kreen can make these without any particular need for materials so though they do not last long it could possibly sell them as familiars or pets or such places.

### Constructed

-   Brick Kiln, Small x 2

    -   Kreen will need lots of bricks so more than one kiln will be needed since some parts of more advanced equipment will take longer than others

-   Brick Kiln, Large

    -   The larger kiln will be needed for floors of some equipment or larger more complex firings of ceramic pieces.

-   Brick Hardener x 2

    -   Metal pieces of more advanced equipment will need slow hardening at different rates. It will need at least two hardeners.

-   Brick Forge

    -   A brick forge can be burnt much more hot so that it can work faster.

### Manufactured

-   Metalworking tools, superior

    -   Mostly hammers and such it will need for a flat pounding surface but Kreen does not need tongs or other such tools though it may need to make some for others to use.

-   Stone working tools, superior

    -   With higher strength chisels Kreen can work with more of its own strength without breaking tools

-   Road spikes

    -   With the road bed dug Kreen will more closely define the road with worked metal spikes.

-   Dig road bed

    -   It will need help with this but if it gets laborers then this should not take too long.
    -   The road will be dug and made level so it will be redistributing a fair amount of dirt.

Phase Three - Advanced tools
----------------------------

Now that Kreen has acceptable tools it can begin to make things to sell as well as increase its building speed. It will auction the other deadhand watches to raise funds. Kreen will need more storage space as the amount of things it makes increases so Kreen will make some warehousing, storehouse for both normal and alchemical goods, a larger and more sturdy workplace, and a lab to put alchemical equipment once it locates more mages. Kreen will likely have at least a few laborers at this point it hopes so Kreen will get beds, food, and clothing for those that want to sleep there or have nowhere else to go. The receptacle may prove difficult to locate as it cannot glyph a vision locus with embedded supplicant node to a being that has already formed one by first sight so the child must be naturally and completely blind. Other than this most of Kreen\'s time will be spent making all the new facilities and buildings though it will dig the road bed while laborers are idle at night. The buildings will be mostly hollow shells with pillars to support the roof so it does not anticipate construction taking too long. Kreen will make time to build shelving and such things as the next phase will involve much more complex constructions and a great deal of parts.

### Purchases

-   Metal Shelves

    -   Kreen will have acquired a great many tools and materials by this point and it is fairly sure it will be easier to purchase shelving for most mundane items
    -   Kreen will still have to manufacture shelving for ingots or other heavy things

-   Alchemical reagents

    -   A great deal of reagents will be consumed during this phase as it will be constructing more complex tools and possibly making more grafts.
    -   Some may not be available on friend Bitflipper\'s plane so Kreen will have to find out what it must replace them with.

-   Rare Metals

    -   These are used for alloys in complex components used in the creation of the shock forge and the two foundations.

-   Steel ingots x 10

    -   Supplies may be running low before it completes the hell\'s mouth smelter so Kreen will purchase some just to be sure.

-   Copper ingots x 20

    -   Kreen will need about twenty ingots for use in the shock forge.

-   Coal (3000 kg)

    -   As the this phase will again entail replacing its existing facilities with superior replacements that run from the shock mount Kreen will need a great deal of coal to make parts.

-   More laborers

    -   It will need a lot of hands to replace everything while making more foundations of artifice tools, making housing and work spaces for mages during the last phases, and manufacturing more tools for the new constructions..

-   Mages

    -   Kreen will need more than a few mages to complete artifice tools
    -   They must be fairly capable and Kreen may find it unlikely to be able to afford more than one or two but it should be able to make do.
    -   It will need a mage of at least the 6<sup>th</sup> circle to finish the castings on parts

-   Food, beds, clothing

    -   Laborers will have accumulated at this point and it will make bunk housing for them and places to sleep for those whom were homeless.
    -   It will need to feed some it expects and Kreen may need to make more sturdy clothing or replacements from wear.

-   Locate a receptacle

    -   Kreen will need to find a receptacle to build the seers though it will take time to ensure the child is robust enough to support the seers.
    -   Location may need to be hastened by small trinkets which identify holders possessing necessary characteristics that Kreen requires.

### Sales

-   Inferior Tools

    -   Whatever remains of its tools will be sold once the superior versions are complete.
    -   Tools Kreen produces will likely still be of acceptable quality even after the use Kreen will put them to.

-   Inferior Facilities

    -   The brick facilities for manufacture will be removed in favor of superior versions so Kreen will see if it can trade them for more immediately useful items or laborers.

-   Deadhand watch x 2

    -   The remaining deadhead watches will be auctioned as should they have a purpose to fulfill on this plane a link to this purpose will have migrated close to Kreen by this point.

-   Replacement necromantic grafts

    -   More grafts sold with mages to help Kreen.
    -   Friend Bitflipper\'s healers seem capable so it may be able to absolve itself of most of the graft process other than to produce the join and create limbs.
    -   Though Kreen finds it distasteful to sell things by auction for the goal of healing missing limbs Kreen will still need things for construction and will have limited time.

-   Ceramic self-mending foundation plates (defectives)

    -   Kreen may produce a few defective parts of not as good quality and though they will not be useful for its purposes they would perhaps make excellent parts for other things.
    -   It has no idea what price these have in the marketplace.

### Constructed

-   Ceramic Forge x 2

    -   Kreen will make two ceramic forges so that it can use one while laborers use another.

-   Ceramic Kiln x 2

    -   As with the forge Kreen will use one while laborers use the other

-   Ceramic Kiln, Large x 1

    -   Kreen will use these with laborers to make the large foundation plates and interior parts used with the artifice tools.

-   Ceramic Plate Kiln x 3

    -   This will assist Kreen is making mundane foundation plates in volume.
    -   Produced plates will not be terribly useful in complex artifice tools but remain self-mending and will be produced in volume for foundations and structure.

-   Ceramic Glass Forge x 2

    -   Kreen will need to make some glass parts and two glass forges should suffice for its needs
    -   They will have a liquid output for when it finishes the shard top roller and the plate glass roller

-   Shock mount

    -   This will abdicate Kreen\'s need for dirty coal firing and be a much more stable and regulated form of power for the forges.
    -   It will take personal effort by Kreen and passively couple to generate energy.
    -   This energy will be stored in the shock mount and Kreen will need to charge it fairly often.

-   Ashen works foundation

    -   This will involve a great deal of heat-resistant ceramics and other materials for the burning chambers.
    -   Burns organic materials at high temperature and gather the ash.
    -   Kreen expects it may end up with some metal slag deposited in a lower chamber with smelter waste but it can purify that later
    -   This will provide raw materials to fuel the entropy demiurge and other necrotic artifice.
    -   It will also receive the smoke output of the smelter as to not waste materials.

-   Hell\'s mouth smelter foundation

    -   Kreen will need to make a fairly deep tall hole for this foundation but it will enable Kreen to reduce ore to usable materials for purification.

-   Sealed waste receptacle

    -   It will not be able to do anything with slag or other useless waste products by the smelter until the elemental separator is completed.
    -   Kreen will deposit waste from various places here until the elemental separator has completed to reprocess it.

-   Reinforced cobblestone grinder

    -   Kreen will make a simple cobblestone grinder as it will have the manpower to spare running the grinder
    -   This will quicken the production of usable cobblestone though Kreen will need a source of water.

### Manufactured

-   Alchemical equipment

    -   Kreen is sure the mages will require various alchemical equipment and Kreen will manufacture it as they demand

-   Smelting equipment

    -   It will need some mundane equipment for the smelter and separator and Kreen will being manufacturing it to store in the warehouse

-   Bunkhouse, (10m x 20m)

    -   It assumes the laborers it finds will need to be idle and other such things every so often so it will make a place they can eat and lay idle.

-   Brick storehouse (20m x 20m)

    -   The warehouse will be fairly simple and consist of light ceramic shelving that will support construction materials and components as it completes them

-   Brick workplace (20m x 20m)

    -   It assumes the mages will need a workplace for castings and such so it will design a building to house them and their materials.

-   Alchemy lab (15m x 5m)

    -   Alchemical things will have increased in volume by this point so Kreen will build a large lab with more robust equipment for use by Kreen and mages.

-   Ore and scrap hopper x 3

    -   Kreen will need a place to store scrap materials it buys for melting as well as ores of various types.
    -   Primarily Kreen will be using steel, copper, and scrap as other materials will be melted down to small volume.

-   Alchemical storehouse (5m x 5m)

    -   Various glass jars and things used in alchemical business Kreen will put here as they are potentially hazardous and valuable.
    -   Kreen will make a mage locked door so only mages will have the skills to open it.
    -   The door will be heavy as will the building as to resist explosives which is usually how Kreen got through them.

-   Remove road obstacles and dig road bed

    -   Some large trees may need to be cut down while making the road though it will move small ones if it can.
    -   The road bed will mostly need to be dug flat so Kreen can start laying edging without having the road wash away.

Phase Four - Artifice Tool Construction
---------------------------------------

This phase will begin the tools Kreen will use to construct the conjugate gate itself. With the ash works foundation complete the main building can be constructed. It will make a large hopper so cartloads can be dumped in directly and that will require some digging to build a ramp. Other purchases will involve materials used in the advanced artifice construction tools. Rare metals, quartz, fresh blood, scrap metal, gold, lead, silver, and iron ore. As it will need to make some parts that cannot be easily broken down into smaller components Kreen will need to hire some mages of better strength. As with most of the other things it produces it may have some defective parts it can sell that would still be useful for mundane construction. If Kreen has some free time it will make more grafts, smelt as much scrap metal into refined steel, forge some shadelings, and sell defective parts being manufactured such as the shade steel backed self-grafting plate as well as the remaining coal supplies. The tools Kreen will construct this phase are for the purpose of constructing the parts needed to make the maelstrom chamber and related equipment as well as to power it with the entropy demiurge. As always Kreen will be producing yet more alchemical equipment to process or replace as the mages need them.

### Purchases

-   Scrap metal

    -   As soon as the hell\'s mouth smelter is complete Kreen will begin making ingots for further use.
    -   The materials do not need to be expressly metal as it will vent the smelter directly to the ash works for further processing

-   Burnable organic Material

    -   Materials to burn for the ash works will need to be piled for use once it is complete to ensure a constant fuel supply.
    -   It may not need to pay for this but Kreen is fairly sure humans will have trash piles somewhere it can buy rather than harvest material from the forest.

-   Iron Ore

    -   Kreen will have a smelter and would prefer some fresh iron ore even if it can recycle some steel.
    -   It will use the fresh ore in alloys for sensitive equipment as well as it will not be tainted by manufacturing or induced glyph work by sentient contact.

-   Rare metals

    -   Kreen will need various rare metals for alloys and metal-imbued ceramics for use in various construction buildings as their complexity increases.
    -   It is not sure what they are called on Bitflipper\'s world but it may need to find substitutes and learn what materials friend Bitflipper\'s people have access to.

-   Quartz

    -   It will need a great deal of quartz or other conductive crystal for use in producing template crystals in the geode chamber.
    -   Gems could be made with the geode chamber but not with the shock mount
    -   Gems of high pressure take much more energy and longer to form. It does not want to spin for that long.

-   Gold, Silver, and Lead

    -   Kreen will start to need materials for shielding on some of the constructed tools.

-   Fresh blood (source irrelevant)

    -   Kreen will need to make shade steel plates for various gears and equipment parts and it will need some blood for this.
    -   The source is irrelevant as the shade steel is of low grade so it can make use of any herd farmers.
    -   Its use is not in directly enchanted materials so a high grade is not needed.

-   Alchemical reagents

    -   As always the mages will need reagents for things it makes for them to enchant.
    -   Kreen may be consuming a great deal of some alchemical things at this point.

-   High strength mages

    -   Modular and low in specific power they may be further tools will have some parts too strong for lay mages to enchant without unnecessarily large waste in design of the part\'s function.
    -   They will be expensive it is sure and Kreen will have to negotiate some payment acceptable to them.

### Sales

-   Necromantic Grafts

    -   Kreen will have little time to gain funds by making grafts at this phase but if it can it will.
    -   Mages will be needed more than raw labor but it will always find something to do for those that wish to work.

-   Shade steel plates with ablative ceramic coating

    -   Plates sold will be rejects though acceptable production will be used for some interior noncritical parts to the entropy demiurge
    -   Many will be produced though the process though only a small amount will be defective.

-   High purity steel

    -   Kreen should be able to start gaining more steel than it can use at this point.
    -   It will sell overstock to purchase more expensive materials.

-   Shadelings

    -   Kreen will make a few shadelings to sell since they take less time to make than the necromantic grafts.
    -   Life span of a shadeling depends on environment as kept in an area of full darkness they will persist for at least a decade.
    -   They do not have an appreciable strength but some mages may find them useful familiars so it may be able to attract some more persons to work on its things.

-   Remaining Coal

    -   At this point Kreen will not require coal or coke so it will sell any remaining stock to whoever will take it away as it is no more valuable than any other burnable material with more hazardous impurities than plant material itself that it can\'t yet dispose of.

### Constructed

-   Geode Chamber

    -   Kreen will need gems of specific sizes and purities for various equipment parts of high complexity or energy transference so this chamber will create them with seed materials.
    -   The shock works will be badly depleted by this and Kreen can\'t operate both at once so the chamber is likely to produce a significant portion of defective gems in the next phase until the entropy demiurge is complete.

-   Magehand Kiln

    -   Kreen will need some oddly shaped ceramic plates that would have to be manually assembled and this equipment will resolve that problem
    -   High temperature ceramics can be produced and formed into shapes at will on the inside of the kiln as long as the user is passably experienced with artifice use.

-   Plate glass roller

    -   Kreen will need some plate glass and a roller will speed this process.
    -   It is a mundane piece and should not take Kreen too much effort to produce.

-   Shard Top Array

    -   Stained glass is preferable for enchanted panes but they can be difficult to cut repeatedly and a shard top array for use by any reasonable skill will fix this.

<!-- -->

-   Abyssal Forge

    -   The abyssal forge is a walk-in forge that maintains a consistent temperature of all volume inside it
    -   Without heat emanating from a specific side or location It is easier for Kreen to forge items with higher strength and accuracy.

-   Hell\'s mouth smelter

    -   This smelter can function for short periods from the shock mount
    -   Once Kreen has this smelter completed it will be able to reprocess waste materials from human settlements into raw metals.
    -   The smelter may produce hazardous chemicals but the ash works will deposit those into slag in the waste storage canister.

-   Ashen works

    -   This is a passive tool to reform raw material, chaos, and death to power necromancy-based artifice.
    -   It will use extensive shielding of various types and redundant layers.
    -   Each layer will be self repairing as to make only intentional breaches of waste feasible.

<!-- -->

-   -   The shielding is to shade from rot light or glyph work residue leaving the proper channels.
    -   All walls of the lower waste chamber will be further reinforced with rot-light resistant ceramic plating and this can be done in stages to minimize down time.
    -   The main ash works chamber will use gold inlays for mana channeling to reduce the degrading effect of rot light.
    -   The entropy demiurge will produce some hazardous materials of high density and deposit in the lower chamber before later entering the elemental separator

<!-- -->

-   Ashen processor

    -   This is a simple valve field array that diverts materials not suitable for use by necromantic artifice
    -   It will first be connected to the waste chamber before the elemental separator is completed.
    -   As it is connected to the ash works it will be made multi-redundant as not to expose waste from the entropy demiurge directly to the environment.
    -   design strength will be as to reduce the possibilities of breach by wear down to intentional damage.

<!-- -->

-   Maelstrom chamber foundation

    -   The maelstrom chamber foundation will be very involved and take as much time as the chamber itself
    -   A large volume will need to be excavated so humans can walk freely among controls and components.
    -   This will be the major ongoing portion of this phase and occupy most mage-time and labor.

-   Ashen Channels

    -   These will take time to dig and lay. Kreen will dig them down deep and encase in their own tunnel for protection
    -   The outer tunnel superstructure will be impermeable and well reinforced though Kreen will leave room for humans.

### Manufactured

-   Alchemical equipment

    -   Kreen is quite sure the needs of mages for equipment, dead or otherwise, will be never ending

-   Glyph-ablative ceramic piping

    -   Much piping of various sizes will be required for the maelstrom chamber foundation
    -   Some will be employed for a valve that connects the maelstrom chamber output to the waste chamber.

-   Brick road edging

    -   Kreen will mark the road with brick edging to reduce erosion in the long term.
    -   It may need to do some spot-repair on the road or places that have already washed away

-   Prepare receptacle

    -   Eye sockets of the receptacle will receive and power seers though Kreen will try to minimize unavoidable pain for the child during the process of removing current eyes and replacing with temporary ones while the child recovers from the procedure.
    -   Some healers for the operation will be needed for anesthetics as it is somewhat unused to working on living beings while minimizing pain.

Phase Five -- Tool Completion
-----------------------------

This stage will complete the tools it needs to create the conjugate gate. Raw material will be purchased in quantity to begin stockpiling enough metal to complete the next phase. Kreen will be able to process nearly any solid material back into component metals with the hell\'s mouth smelter after reducing it to ash and slag with the ash works. It will also need a water supply from the area and since there seems to be some underground system connected to housing Kreen may be able to tap that for use. Kreen will need a blood source to make doppleganger steel but it does not need to be sentient. Blood from usual human animal butchery is acceptable as long as it is fresh. With most of the artifice equipment complete Kreen will be able to smelt out a great quantity of metal and much more steel than it can productively use compared to how much scrap it is capable of intaking. This should give Kreen more regular resources to complete the gate. As all of Kreen\'s time during the latter stages will be absorbed in creating the core and related equipment it will not have time to make items for sale so Kreen needs to prepare things others can complete. Among this is lightning transference as it is sure the conduits strung across friend Bitflipper\'s landscape are emitting fields of such conduction so it must have some great value to the marketplace. Kreen will be making a great deal of doppleganger steel so if funds are not sufficient Kreen can take commissions to forge designs. At this point Kreen will take time to add a book of artifice spell work for the mages to use in assembling the machinery Kreen will forge later. They must be familiar so Kreen will make the information available now so they may practice. The rest of the constructions are interconnected and require each other to function safely so Kreen must build them all at once so it can use them all at once. Kreen will make a few small soundproof private quarters for the mages to practice in training for the eventual core activation ritual. Various equipment such as the glyphsure armor will be produced as well as Seers since the child will hopefully have recovered fully by now.

### Purchases

-   Seed Crystals

    -   Kreen will need bits of crystals to seed the geode chamber with.
    -   It does not need much of any one type so it would not cost too much.

-   Fine Sand

    -   As Kreen will need to make glass of various types for the core and maelstrom it will need fine sand in quantity.

-   Lamp oil

    -   Some lamp oil will be needed for metalworking some sensitive parts.
    -   Lamp oil is not cheap to produce where it comes from so it will assume a few gallons will be expensive.

-   Scrap Metal

    -   With the shock mount and hell\'s mouth smelter complete Kreen will be able to consume as much scrap metal as it can afford and resell as ingots.
    -   Consumption will also be limited by how long Kreen is willing to spend too dizzy to function.

-   Organic and metal refuse

    -   Other metals bound inside wood and such can be burnt in the ash works then sent back to the smelter.
    -   Kreen refers mostly to human refuse but it is not sure what kind of materials friend Bitflipper\'s people produce.

-   High strength mages

    -   Kreen will need yet more mages and hopefully it will be able to sell enough material to afford them.

-   Water

    -   A reliable water supply will be required from the area.
    -   It may have to build an aqueduct to the nearest water source.

-   Fresh blood (source irrelevant)

    -   Though it may still need this material for the backing of the shade steel plates it will also need some more for the doppleganger steel.
    -   Kreen will purchase the materials from the same source if possible.

### Sales

-   Self grafting ceramic plate (lower quality rejects)

    -   These will be needed in various parts of the maelstrom forge

-   Steel ingots

    -   Kreen will producing these quite readily if it can acquire scrap in volume and will probably exceed its needs on a regular basis.

-   Lightning transference

    -   Reliability of supply over a few days at a time cannot be guaranteed but it is aware friend Bitflipper\'s plane uses lightning in some concerted fashion.
    -   Coupling the shock mount into the conduits it sees spread across the landscape will take knowledge it does not have though Kreen can build an efficient conduit to a particular destination or supply the necessary parts for others to do so if it is worth its time.

-   Doppleganger Steel

    -   This steel will remember its original form and exert pressure to regain its original shape dependent on thickness.
    -   Kreen will need to know the appropriate shape ahead of time so it may need to take orders for such things.
    -   It will only sell of its surplus as the backing is necessary for the high resiliency self-grafting ceramic plate.

### Constructed

-   Mage Library

    -   The various mages can collate their knowledge in a library more effectively as they will need to work as a whole to create the mythal.
    -   It will write the various spell forms necessary to train to activate the artifice components Kreen will create

-   High capacity Grinder

    -   This will be attached directly to the ash works intake
    -   Intended to reduce solid scrap at volume to smaller bits that take less time to melt
    -   Replacement bits for the grinder will be made just in case but the doppleganger steel should avoid significant deformation.

-   Elemental Separator

    -   This will use a form of invisible servant to intake hot gases and spent ashen from the ash works, separate them into their own containers of like material, then to cool down to a solid.
    -   Materials that are still gases will enter the casings at high pressure and as the materials are somewhat randomly dispersed Kreen will make all containers pressure-tolerant.
    -   Hosts of canisters will be made for materials that are not solid at air temperatures.
    -   Some bonds are not easily broken but all deposits will be of uniform, pure, and stable material so further disposal will involve identification.

-   Maelstrom Exit Energy Disperser

    -   Once the unification is complete a great deal of energy will remain on its bindings and must be safely grounded.
    -   It will be a great sudden pressure of lightning and as such is difficult to harness productively.
    -   Ceramic conduits that will not melt on the inrush of energy will be required that will take the most time for this construction.

-   Maelstrom Interlock

    -   When Kreen exits the maelstrom chamber its frame of reference will be perturbed and will be charged as itselves unify to a regular frame of time.
    -   Interlock equipment ensures planar disturbances do not affect the area when Kreen is in progress of leaving the maelstrom chamber
    -   The exit energy disperser has its receiving node in the center of the chamber and mages must sustain the cooling field surrounding the interlock

-   Maelstrom Control

    -   The maelstrom core cannot be controlled from inside as that makes the design much more complicated and expensive
    -   A scrying node will be installed into the control area for a trained mage to communicate directly with Kreen.

-   Maelstrom Initiation Dome

    -   The initiation dome produces the maelstrom environment conditions before venting into the maelstrom chamber where it is self-sustaining
    -   This chamber though insulated still produces residual glyph effects and will be housed in the same building as the entropy demiurge.
    -   The maelstrom initiation dome will have a direct connection to the entropy demiurge as it will consume a great deal of energy to confine the maelstrom and still observe it
    -   It will design the dome to disable all other consumption of the entropy demiurge while initiating a maelstrom as spikes in consumption are expected.
    -   Should the maelstrom exceed the productive capacity of the entropy demiurge, a small chance but prudent to accommodate, the dome will momentarily phase into the ethereal plane to explode safely without risk to operating personnel. When this occurs Kreen will need to manufacture a new core casing once the housing returns to the material. There will be little risk of permanent damage to properly equipped personnel other than a fair risk of temporary blindness or heat related illness from the glow and temperature of phased material exposure for a few hours. The area housing will be plane-locked and The failed maelstrom will fade within the locked building within a few hours. When the maelstrom chamber is rebuilt the material lingering in the ethereal will reintegrate with the prime maelstrom due to its trans-planar nature.

-   Entropy Demiurge

    -   This equipment will intake the ash produced by the ash works and consume the chaos, death and ash to produce energy as well as varied elemental materials.
    -   Output from the entropy demiurge will be connected to the elemental separator so that the materials it produces will be recovered.
    -   The same channels as the shock mount will be used though Kreen will have to run new channels to connect to them and install equipment to combine their outputs

### Manufactured

-   Gatekeeper

    -   As the next phase begins the construction of the metasentient core Kreen will produce some seers for when the core is activated.
    -   A gatekeeper will be needed as once the metasentient is constructed Kreen will induct token bearers and assign a designate

-   Ordermonger

    -   At least one Ordermonger to see to cursory maintenance of the metasentient as soon as it is operating

-   Brighteyed x 2

    -   Kreen will make two of these for when the metasentient is completed since it may be disorienting for the child receptacle to employ two different types of lens assembly

-   Darkeyed x 2

    -   These seers will be constructed after the Brighteyed and in pair for the same reason

-   Alchemical Tools

    -   Nothing less than the eternal need for more tools is expected from mages

-   Laborer Tools

    -   Kreen will make some more laborer tools as it may be running low at this point and it does not want to have laborers working with poor materials

-   Mage equipment

    -   Kreen will need to make some smaller apparatus for the higher level mages to use for things it requires of them
    -   Training materials for the glyph artifice assembly will be other equipment Kreen will produce

-   Glyphsure armor

    -   Enough suits of this armor will be made for every mage under its employ as well as a few extra of different sizes just in case of visitors or a need for replacement.
    -   They will protect mages inside the building for the entropy demiurge and maelstrom chamber.
    -   Kreen will try to keep them to a low weight as to not weigh down the mages during casting.

-   Burn charges

    -   Kreen will make a great deal of these rods for use in the glyphsure armor
    -   Their purpose is that of providing dispel charges that dissipate the glyphs attempting to transit working mages

<!-- -->

-   Mage Housing (5m x 5m) x 6

    -   More housing for mages will be needed if only to give private practicing areas for concentration for the skilled.
    -   They will be in the same dwarven style as the bunkhouses though intended for a single person or group.

-   Gathered materials

    -   Though it will have stockpiled a great deal of high quality metals and materials Kreen will still be able to intake more than it can consume.

### Constructed

-   Sourcer well x 2

    -   With the building base completed Kreen avoids the chance of a blowout as the base will regulate bore pressure
    -   Conventional equipment modified by the base will bore to the ley node.

-   Site ponds

    -   As the area may produce vibration Kreen will surround the area with ponds to muffle the noise
    -   It will make sure the ponds are properly lined so they do not immediately drain and will better serve their purpose besides

-   Aqueduct

    -   It would like a water source and an aqueduct is the easiest way for Kreen to get it from the city water
