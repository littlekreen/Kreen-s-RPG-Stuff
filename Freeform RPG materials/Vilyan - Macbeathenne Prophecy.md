MacBeathenne Prophecy
=====================

Triggers
--------

Black limousine

Bitflipper Macbeathenne

Scene 1 -- Introduction
-----------------------

### Lyrics:

None

### Actions:

Man standing next to limousine inhales deeply and enters as others enter.

Immediately drives off as the tribal music begins.

Passed by a middle east city in a strong red light being sacked by roman and Celtic troops.

Scene 2 -- First stanza in car
------------------------------

### Lyrics:

Please allow me to introduce myself

I\'m a man of wealth and taste

I\'ve been around for a long, long year

Stole many a man\'s fold and faith

And I was \'round when his majesty

Had his moment of doubt and pain

### Actions:

Adjusts mirror so face can\'t be seen

Wearing ragged hoodie obscuring hair and face.

Scene 3 - room entry
--------------------

### Lyrics:

Made damn sure that Oberon

Washed his hands and sealed his fate

### Actions:

Abrupt stop without momentum inside a black room with curtains on three walls

Changes to look like Oberon

Gets out to a pedestal with a water basin that changes to blood as he washes his hands.

Shakes his head disapprovingly

Scene 4 -- Greeting
-------------------

### Lyrics:

Pleased to meet you

Hope you guess my name

But what\'s puzzling you

Is the nature of my game

### Actions:

Returns to normal

Turns slightly to look at the two passengers

Too dark to see the face

Candle-lit room with black/red theme.

Walks over to first curtain and throws it wide.

Scene 4 -- First curtain
------------------------

### Lyrics:

I watched with glee

While your kings and queens

Fought for man\'s decades

For the gods they made

(woo woo, woo woo)

### Actions:

Changes back to hoodied male

Artillery rains down on the city below with a deeply overcast sky

Gestures with hands wide to light up twin pedestals

Pedestals show an atomic bomb and a column ringed by mages with hand held high and a bronze sphere at its top.

Scene 5 -- Enthusiasm
---------------------

### Lyrics:

I shouted out,

\"Who killed the Innocents?\"

When after all

It was you and me

(who who, who who)

### Actions:

Both items begin to shatter the city and countryside.

Wind rattles the window then shatters it inward.

Glass shattered showers in and past as the rumble of weaponry goes off.

The hot plasma, lukewarm against the skin, throws an immolated body past them to turn to dust on impacting the ceiling.

Scene 6 -- Transition to other curtain
--------------------------------------

### Lyrics:

Let me please introduce myself

I\'m a man of wealth and taste

### Actions: 

Turns but the dark room and back lit light in the non-reflective room still does not show his face.

Just shows a set of glowing blue eyes and glaring white human teeth.

Starts moving to the curtain on the other side of the room which begins to retract.

Scene 7 -- Right window
-----------------------

### Lyrics: 

And I laid traps for troubadours

Who get killed before they reached Bombay

(woo woo, who who)

### Actions: 

Hand against the immaculate window on the other side

Window shows the active ritual circle of a hell strike surrounded by ravens representing the fey.

There\'s one flash of a discharged spell then another flash from an immolated caster as a black nova springs out from him

Nova rips flesh off their bones and they fall apart for black amorphous forms to crawl out of the parts.

Scene 8 -- Pressed to glass
---------------------------

### Lyrics:

Pleased to meet you

Hope you guessed my name, oh yeah

(who who)

### Actions:

Turns to look back as the nova flings bodies

Gleevil shining eyes look back for the stanza

Raven approaches propelled through midair during stanza

Scene 9 -- Impact
-----------------

### Lyrics:

But what\'s puzzling you

Is the nature of my game, oh yeah, get down, baby

(who who, who who)

### Actions:

Female raven slowly falls apart to ash and clay on hitting the window as it slides down the window leaving a track of dirt.

Figure presses face to glass and laughs the line of the stanza to get down

Scene 10 -- Aftermath
---------------------

### Lyrics:

(solo)

### Actions:

Laughs continuously

In the background dread wraiths coalesce and begin murdering other ravens whom create more wraiths in the same dying manner.

Scene 11 -- Cold Turn
---------------------

### Lyrics:

Pleased to meet you  
Hope you guessed my name, oh yeah  
But what\'s confusing you  
Is just the nature of my game  
(woo woo, who who)

### Actions:

Turns about with a flat expression

Scene advances behind him still

Walks back to group

Approaches light

Scene 12 -- Reveal
------------------

### Lyrics:

Just as every cop is a criminal

And all the sinners saints

As heads is tails

Just call me Lucifer

\'Cause I\'m in need of some restraint

### Actions: 

Flashes of light from the first window reveal different faces as explosions and flares alight

Approaches light and first seems a cop with a wide brimmed hat

Next flash is a priest with a wide hat hiding his face

Kneels down where a altar boy where he kisses the boy\'s hand after saints line

Lets hand of boy go and stands up to walk toward the light where Bitflipper is.

Light reveals Bitflipper in the same opalescent robe on same line as declaring himself as lucifer

Looks at the altar boy for the restraint line.

Scene 13 - Worry
----------------

### Lyrics:

So if you meet me

Have some courtesy

Have some sympathy, and some taste

Use all your well-learned politesse

Or I\'ll lay your s-soul to waste, oh yeah

### Actions:

What was the altar boy takes his hand for a moment but is now fluttering between ebony and brass skin

Machine/Kreen (altar boy) runs away as light follows along the unreflective floor.

Floor reveals that of vampires and other undead underfoot.

Turns and reaches out toward the machine/Kreen (altar boy) during politesse line as machine/Kreen (altar boy) leaps toward a kneeling figure with spear held high

After the machine/Kreen (altar boy) lands on the knelt figure fade to black that area

The false Bitflipper turns around nose to nose with the real Bitflipper

Face is composed of the machine (gunmetal gears)

Says soul to waste line with eyes that threaten but a voice that lets slip a profound worry.

Scene 14 -- Wrap-up
-------------------

### Lyrics:

Pleased to meet you

Hope you guessed my name, um yeah

(who who)

But what\'s puzzling you

Is the nature of my game, um mean it, get down

### Actions:

Gives a wry smile at the pleased to meet you line

Backs up and puts hoodie back up of the opalescent robe.

Form fades to gray then to shadow itself as the curtains close on the scenes they cover.
