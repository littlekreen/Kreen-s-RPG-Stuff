15. **Abilities:** 

    -   *Oracle (su)* - Vilyan becomes aware of possible futures when dreaming and as well never forgets any dreams. These dreams are vivid and colorful during her random activation of powers despite her natural blindness which fosters her painting habits. She has no control whatsoever for these visions over who it targets though they can be inspired by items in her possession and are always of individuals that cause or are a participant in a great change. A random psi power of hers targets a creature in the future regardless of distance or plane. The dream chooses a new target once an hour while asleep with the effect taken from this table at random. Vilyan becomes aware of up to 1d3 major possible futures in an activation should more than one outcome exist for any actions taken. Vilyan can choose to follow any action in the tree at will but eventually her hour with the target will expire. 

        -   Affect 

            -   Destiny Dissonance - Induces Deja vu in the target, Vilyan awakes confused. 
            -   Call to Mind - The target recalls an important detail about their current activity or goal, sharing it with Vilyan 
            -   Body Adjustment - Vilyan perceives a grievous harm done to the subject in so doing inhibiting some of the damage. 
            -   Body Purification - Vilyan gains knowledge of the symbolic name that caused the drain of ability to the target in repairing some of the damage as she leaves. 

        -   Know 

            -   Precognition - Vilyan gains a blur of information related to the target in symbolic form then wakes up 
            -   Missive - Vilyan gains a fragment of a written text the target perceives as most important to their current activity 
            -   Missive, Mass - Vilyan gains a single page of a written text the target perceives as most important to their current activity. 

        -   Perceive 

            -   Empathy - Vilyan becomes aware of the area the target is in and the emotions of those in the vicinity. If any great suffering is present it drives Vilyan awake. 
            -   Object Reading - When activated, this power shows Vilyan the last important thing done with an item type held by her to a target that possesses the same type of item. The closer the example the more likely the vision will be relevant though the example can be merely a picture. 
            -   Aura Sight - Centered on the target, Vilyan gains awareness as per the spell though without vision and the names of each participant in symbolic terms 
            -   Correspond - Vilyan gains knowledge of the most important conversation the target has had in the last day. 

        -   Interact 

            -   Sense Link - Vilyan gains either sight, hearing,or touch of a target 
            -   Clairvoyant Sense - Vilyan becomes superimposed on a single moment of great change but cannot change the static environment to follow the possible futures. 
            -   Remote Viewing - Vilyan becomes physically present in a locale as an solid ectoplasmic form. Can be seen and perceived by those around her though only as a presence on the edge of their vision unless she directly interacts with them. If Vilyan takes any damage the current vision ends and she wakes with nonlethal damage.

16. *Lost (su)* - Vilyan is one of the many Lost inhabiting Kreen and has proved as intensely bound to the construct as the rest of the Lost. Lost cannot be imprisoned in any container for spirits and are heavily resistant to all effects arising from necromantic or death magic. Cannot be removed or willfully remove her physical or spiritual self from Kreen in any other way than the temporary astral form during her visions. 
17. *Wracked (sp)* Vilyan has been killed and the true tether to her tree was severed by this. Kreen has artificially restored the connection to the best of its abilities inside of the limitations of her being Lost. This results in her losing dryad spell-like abilities but regaining a solid semblance of her body and no longer being in constant agony from the last memory of torture. Kreen isn\'t aware of any other effects due to abruptly ceasing research after this point. Unfortunately neither is Vilyan aware of the effects as her memory is erased every day when she sleeps whereupon it starts anew when waking up. She wakes from some point just before she was tortured unless expending a great deal of concentration just to maintain some semblance of contiguous memory.
